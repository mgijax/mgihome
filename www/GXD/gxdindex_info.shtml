<p>
The GXD Index is an index of research reports documenting <strong>data on endogenous 
gene expression during mouse development</strong> that have been published <strong>from May 1993 to present</strong>. 
Few reports published before May  1993 are included. The index will be kept up-to-date with regard to new publications 
and continue to be back-populated with reports published before 1993.
<P>
The GXD Index includes references, genes and embryonic stages analyzed, and expression assays used. 
Thus, the index provides information about assays used to study a given gene, for which stages of 
mouse development these assays have been performed, and supporting references.
<P>
The Gene Expression Database project aims for a comprehensive annotation of these expression data. 
For more information go <a href="gxdgen.shtml">here</a>.
<P>
The GXD Index is integrated with the Mouse Genome Database to foster a close link between genotype, 
expression and phenotype information.
<P>

To search the GXD Index, use the <A HREF="../searches/gxdindex_form.shtml">GXD Index Query Form</a>. Instructions for using 
this query form are online and can be accessed by clicking on a field name in the form. Follow the 
links in the query result summary to obtain the detailed results.  The detailed results are represented in 
tables.  <B>Please use a WWW browser that can display tables to see these results properly.</B> 
<P>
MGD also provides access to GXD records by providing links in the detailed query results for marker and references.
