<h2>The Mouse Gene Expression Information Resource Project</h2>

<p>The Mouse Gene Expression Information Resource (MGEIR) is being developed collaboratively by the GXD project and the Edinburgh Mouse Atlas project.  MGEIR will provide the scientific community with a unified resource that combines text-based and 3D graphical methods to store, display, and analyze mouse developmental gene expression information. 
<p>

<p>
The Mouse Gene Expression Information Resource resource will consist of the following components: 
<p>
<ul>
<li><em>Gene Expression Database (GXD)</em><br>
Integrates different types of expression data and provides links to many other resources to place the data into the larger biological and analytical context. The time and space of gene expression is described by a controlled Dictionary of Anatomical Terms that is part of the Anatomy Database. Database records in GXD are complemented by 2D images of the original expression data.  (For details, see <a href="aboutGXD.shtml">About GXD</a>).<br><br>

<li><em>Anatomy Database</em><br>
Provides the standard nomenclature for queries relating gene expression to developmental anatomy. The dictionary names the tissues and structures for each developmental stage. Fate tables listing the progenitor(s) and derivative(s) for each structure enable analysis of differentiation pathways. A thesaurus of alternative terminology adds flexibility to database queries. <br><br>

<li><em>3D Atlas / Graphical Gene Expression Database</em><br>
Provides a high-resolution digital representation of mouse anatomy reconstructed from serial sections of single embryos at each representative developmental stage enabling 3D graphical display and analysis of in situ expression data. The tissues of the 3D atlas are labeled and assigned to the terms from the anatomical dictionary. These assignments provide links to the Gene Expression Database. In the intermediate term, in situ expression patterns observed can be colored-in into the 3D reconstructions. The ultimate goal is to transfer electronically digitized in situ data from different embryos into the 3D atlas.
</ul>

<h3>Who is doing what?</h3>

<p>GXD has been developed and continues to be maintained and enhanced by the GXD team at the Jackson Laboratory. 

<p>Stages 1 through 26 (embryonic development) of the Standard Anatomical Nomenclature Database have been developed and continue to be refined at the Department of Anatomy, University of Edinburgh, Scotland and the MRC Human Genetics Unit, Edinburgh. Stages 27 and 28 (newborn and postnatal mouse) are being developed by the GXD team.

<p>The  3D Atlas / Graphical Gene Expression Database is being developed at MRC Human Genetics Unit, Edinburgh and at the Department of Anatomy, University of Edinburgh, Scotland.

<p>The GXD Project is supported by NIH grant HD33745. Work at Edinburgh is supported by the MRC, the BBSRC, and by the European Science Foundation.
