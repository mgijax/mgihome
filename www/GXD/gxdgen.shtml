The process of differential gene expression generates extraordinarily  complex spatio-temporal networks 
of gene and protein interactions. To understand the molecular mechanisms of health and disease, 
we need to understand these networks.
Thus, as the emphasis in biomedical research shifts from 
identifying genes to characterizing their biological functions, knowledge of gene expression patterns 
becomes crucial. 
<P>
Numerous methods of measuring gene expression have recently been developed and data on gene 
expression are rapidly accumulating. It is no longer possible to track relevant information without using 
electronic data storage, retrieval and display tools. It is increasingly likely, moreover, that important 
relationships are missed because of the density and diversity of information.
<P>
The <em>Gene Expression Information Resource for Mouse Development</em> that we are building will combine 3D graphical displays and discrete descriptive information to make gene 
expression data freely and widely available in formats appropriate for thorough analysis. Integration with 
the <em>Mouse Genome Database (MGD)</em> and interconnection with other databases containing 
DNA and protein sequence information, genetic and physical mapping data  and descriptions of disease 
states and mutant mice will place the gene expression database into the proper biological and analytical 
context.
Thus, the <em>Gene Expression Information Resource</em> should provide the scientific 
community with a tool for examining patterns of gene expression during mouse embryonic development, 
elucidating biologically important molecular networks, and exploring the genetic programs that underlie 
normal development and disease.

The Gene Expression Information Resource will consist of three main components:<P>
<UL>
<LI><EM>Gene Expression Database (GXD)</EM><BR>Integrates the many types of expression data and 
provides links to other relevant resources to place the data into the larger biological and analytical context. The time and space of gene expression is described by a  controlled Dictionary of Anatomical Terms that is part of the Anatomy Database. 
For in situ expression assays, the textual annotations in GXD are complemented by 2D images of original expression data that are indexed via the terms from the dictionary.<P>
<LI><EM>Anatomy Database</EM><BR>Provides the standard nomenclature for queries relating gene expression to developmental anatomy. The dictionary names the tissues and structures for each developmental stage.  Fate tables listing the progenitor(s) and derivative(s) for each structure enable analysis of differentiation pathways. A thesaurus of alternative terminology adds flexibility to database queries.
<P>
<LI><EM>3D Atlas</EM><BR>Provides a high resolution digital representation of mouse anatomy reconstructed from serial sections of single embryos at each representative developmental stage enabling 3D graphical display and analysis of in situ expression data. The tissues of the 3D atlas are labeled and assigned to the terms from the anatomical dictionary. This assignment provides the link to the Gene Expression Database. 
In the intermediate term, in situ expression patterns observed can be colored-in into the 3D reconstructions. The ultimate goal is to transfer electronically digitized in situ data from different embryos into the 3D atlas.
</UL><P>
To meet both the short term and the long term requirement of the community, the Gene Expression 
Resource will be developed in steps. The first available resource will be the text + 2D image system provided by GXD and the Anatomy Database. Later, 
the 3D atlas will be integrated to enable sophisticated three-dimensional storage, display and analysis capabilities.<P>

<h3><A NAME="concept">The Gene Expression Database (GXD)</A> 
</h3>
<B>Concept</B><p>
One gene can encode alternative RNAs and proteins with distinct expression
patterns and biological activities. The different expression assays
available give different but complementary insights into these patterns. In
situ studies at the RNA and protein level provide the most detailed
information with regard to time and space of expression. Northern and
Western blot analysis reveal the number and sizes of transcripts. Methods
such as RNAase protection and RT-PCR can detect small amounts of and small
differences in transcripts. The analysis of cDNA clones gives detailed
structural information. Recently developed high throughput expression
methods will provide large amounts of quantitative expression information.
Only by combining the various types of expression data, can we gain
knowledge about what transcripts and proteins are produced by specific
genes, and where, when, and to what extent these  products are expressed at
the cellular level.
 <p>
<IMG SRC="gxd_poster.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
 The design of GXD follows this paradigm. GXD stores primary data from the different expression 
assays. In this format the data can be integrated, new data and new assay types can be readily added, and 
novel insights resulting from new data can be represented. The molecular probes used are conceptualized
to be the driving force for the results reported. For  Northern- and Western blots, RT-PCR, 
RNAase protection assays, etc., the size and the expression pattern are described separately for each
detected band because each band represents a distinct molecular species. Sequence data will be included by 
cross-referencing to other databases. The time and space of gene 
expression are described by the <em>Dictionary of Anatomical Terms</em>. For in situ expression 
assays, the text annotations in GXD are complemented by 2D images of original expression data that are 
indexed using terms from the dictionary. Once those data have been stored in the database, one can ask 
what probes and assays have been used to study the expression of a given gene and get back all relevant 
expression information. Access to comprehensive,  raw expression data provides the best basis for 
proper interpretations. Display and analysis tools are conceptualized as a separate layer of software. They 
will provide computational support for data interpretation and for synthesizing higher order information 
from the available primary data.<p>

Integration with MGD will foster a close link to genetic and phenotypic
data of mouse strains and mouse mutants, and GXD will build a natural
bridge between these data. Extensive interconnections with other relevant
databases will extend GXD's utility for analysis of gene expression
information.<P>

Expression data are and will be annotated from the literature by database
editors. However, standard publication methods are often inadequate for
making gene expression data available. For example, most raw data for in
situ studies are never published but merely referred to in brief text
summaries, and  data derived from high throughput expression methods, such
as the analysis of high density cDNA arrays with complex probes, simply
cannot be made available by standard publication methods. Therefore, the
GXD project has a strong emphasis on electronic data submission from
laboratories. Our goal is to develop an electronic framework for the
research community that enables comprehensive and integrated storage of
expression data for the laboratory mouse, and permits thorough and gobal
analysis of these data.<P>

<STRONG>Current Status</STRONG><p>

GXD has been implemented using the Sybase relational database system.
GXD is integrated with MGD and provides comprehensive links to other
resources.
<P>
Currently, the following data are <A HREF="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->menus/expression_menu.shtml">searchable</A>:
<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><B><A HREF="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->searches/gxdindex_form.shtml">GXD Index</A></B>, a searchable index of research 
	reports documenting data on endogenous gene expression during mouse development, 
	including references,
	genes and embryonic stages analyzed, and expression assays used.<P>

	<LI><B><A HREF="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->searches/estclone_form.shtml">Mouse cDNA data</A></B>, including I.M.A.G.E. clones.<P>

	<LI><B><A HREF="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->searches/expression_form.shtml">RT-PCR, RNA in situ hybridization, Immunohistochemistry, Northern 
and Western Blot data</A></B> 
	
</UL>
<P>

GXD includes a large data set of RT-PCR data reporting expression data for 517 genes in <A HREF="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->userdocs/tissues.shtml">46 tissues</A> 
 (provided by <A HREF="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->searches/reference.cgi?46734">Tom Freeman et al</A>,The Sanger Centre, UK). 
Additional expression data from the various assay types are now being entered into the database and made publicly
available on a daily basis.
<P>
Currently, these data are acquired from the literature by database editors. In the future, we will acquire data primarily
via electronic submission from laboratories. Prototypes of an electronic submission system are being tested and refined
in collaboration with a number of laboratories in North America and Europe with the aim to produce a robust submission system for
the community at large.
