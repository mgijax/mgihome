<H3>About GXD</H3>

The Gene Expression Database (GXD) is a community resource for gene expression information from the laboratory mouse.  GXD stores and integrates different types of expression data and makes these data freely available in formats appropriate for comprehensive analysis. There is particular emphasis on endogenous gene expression during mouse development. The project is funded by
<a href="http://www.nih.gov/">NIH</a>/<a href="http://www.nichd.nih.gov">NICHD</a> grant <a href="http://crisp.cit.nih.gov/crisp/CRISP_LIB.getdoc?textkey=6363398&p_grant_num=5R01HD033745-05&p_query=&ticket=428206&p_audit_session_id=3166451&p_keywords=">HD33745</a>.

<h3><a name="key"></a>Key Concepts of GXD</h3>
<ul>
<li>GXD stores primary data from different types of expression assays. By integrating these data, GXD provides, as data accumulate, increasingly complete information about the expression profiles of transcripts and proteins in different mouse strains and mutants. (<EM>See</EM> <A HREF="gxdconcept.shtml">details</A>.)<p>

<li>GXD describes expression patterns using an extensive, hierarchically-structured dictionary of anatomical terms. In this way, expression results from assays with differing spatial resolution are recorded in a standardized and integrated manner and expression patterns can be queried at different levels of detail.  The records are complemented with digitized images of the original expression data. The Anatomical Dictionary for Mouse Development has been developed by our Edinburgh colleagues, as part of the joint <A HREF="gxdgen.shtml">Mouse Gene Expression Information Resource</a> project. <p>

<li>GXD places the gene expression data in the larger biological context by establishing and maintaining interconnections with many other resources. Integration with MGD and MGS enables a combined analysis of genotype, sequence, expression, and phenotype data. Links to PubMed, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), sequence databases, and databases from other species further enhance the utility of GXD.
</ul>


<h3><a name="acquisition"></a>Data Acquisition</h3>
<ul>
<p>Expression data are acquired from the literature by our curatorial staff and via electronic submission. New data are made available on a daily basis.<br><br>

To facilitate electronic submission of expression data, we have developed the <b>Gene Expression Notebook (GEN)</b>. Implemented in Microsoft&#174; Excel&#153;, the GEN is easy to use and to customize as a laboratory notebook for storing and organizing expression data. Data can then be effortlessly exported for electronic submission to GXD. Researchers interested in obtaining the GEN and its user guide may <a href="../GXD/GEN/">download them here</a>.
</ul>

<h3><a name="forms"></a>Gene Expression  <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/menus/expression_menu.shtml">Query Forms</A></h3>
<UL>
<LI>The <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/searches/gxdindex_form.shtml">Gene Expression Literature Index Query Form</a> allows you to search for references on endogenous gene expression during development, including genes and ages analyzed and assays used. It covers, to the best of our knowledge, all relevant publications from 1993 to the present for all pertinent journals and from 1990 to the present for major developmental journals.</p>

<LI>The <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/searches/expression_form.shtml">Gene Expression Data Query Form</a> allows you to search for detailed expression results from RNA <i>in situ</i>, immunohistochemistry, <i>in situ</i> reporter (knock in), Northern blot, Western blot, RT-PCR and RNAase and Nuclease S1 protection experiments using many query parameters. Experimental results are described together with the probes, specimens, and experimental conditions used and are complemented by digitized images of the original data.</p>

<LI>The <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/searches/expression_form_2.shtml">Gene Expression Data Expanded Query Form</a> is designed to allow you to search for genes expressed in some anatomical structures and/or developmental stages but not in others. This query form allows you to combine the parameters necessary for these queries with most of the query parameters available on the standard Gene Expression Data Query Form.</p>


<LI><A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/searches/anatdict_form.shtml">The Mouse Anatomical Dictionary Browser</a> allows you to navigate through the extensive dictionary hierarchies for the different developmental stages, to locate specific anatomical structures within those hierarchies, and to obtain the expression results associated with those structures.</p>


<li>The <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/searches/estclone_form.shtml">cDNA Clone Query Form</a> allows you to search for expression information derived from cDNA source data using many query parameters.
</ul>


<h3><a name="adult_dict"></a>Anatomical Dictionary for the Adult Mouse</h3>
<ul>
<P>The
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/searches/AMA_form.shtml">Anatomical Dictionary for the Adult Mouse</a> has been developed and continues to be refined to provide standardized nomenclature for annotating expression and phenotype  data for the adult mouse. The Dictionary organizes anatomical structures for the postnatal mouse spatially and functionally.  You can use the browser to view anatomical terms and their relationships in a hierarchical display.  We welcome your input. Please <A HREF="mailto:anatomy@informatics.jax.org">contact</a> us with suggestions, additions, or questions about the Anatomical Dictionary for the Adult Mouse.
