<H2>About GXD</H2>
The purpose of the Gene Expression Database (GXD) is to store and integrate the many types of 
gene expression data on the laboratory mouse; make these data freely and widely available in formats
appropriate for thorough analysis; and provide links to other relevant resources placing
this expression information within a larger biological and analytical context. 
<P>
Currently, the following data are <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->menus/expression_menu.shtml">searchable</A>:
<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><B><A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/gxdindex_form.shtml">GXD Index</A></B>, a searchable index of research 
	reports documenting data on endogeneous gene expression during mouse development, 
	including references,
	genes and embryonic stages analyzed, and expression assays used.<P>

	<LI><B><A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/estclone_form.shtml">Mouse cDNA data</A></B>, including I.M.A.G.E. clones and ESTs.<P>

<P>

GXD includes a large data set of RT-PCR data reporting expression data for 517 genes in <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/tissues.shtml">46 tissues</A> 
 (provided by <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/reference.cgi?46734">Tom Freeman et al</A>,The Sanger Centre, UK). 
Additional expression data from the various assay types are now being entered into the database and made publicly
available on a daily basis.
<P>
Currently, these data are acquired from the literature by database editors. In the future, we will acquire data primarily
via electronic submission from laboratories. Prototypes of an electronic submission system are being tested and refined
in collaboration with a number of laboratories in North America and Europe with the aim to produce a robust submission system for
the community at large. (<EM>See</EM> <A HREF="gxdgen.shtml">details</A> about the GXD project.)
