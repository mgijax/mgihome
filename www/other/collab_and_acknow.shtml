Whenever the MGI and Ensembl gene records unambiguously share Entrez and/or SWISS-PROT identifiers, we establish an association between these records.--> We provide links from our marker detail page to the <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/">Mouse GeneView</a> of the Ensembl Genome Browser. Marker detail pages also link to Ensembl phylogenetic <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/compara/homology_method.html">Gene Trees</a>.
