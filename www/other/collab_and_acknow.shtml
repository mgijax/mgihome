<A HREF="http://genome-www.stanford.edu/GO/">Gene Ontology Consortium</A></B>(GO)
<P><SMALL>We are part of the Gene Ontology Consortium that also currently includes <A HREF="http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu/">Flybase</A> and <A HREF="http://genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces/">SGD</A> (Saccharomyces Genome Database).  We are developing extensive, structured vocabularies for molecular function, biological process, cellular component and annotating genes/gene products within each of our species' databases using these vocabularies. These ontologies and annotations will be accessible from our species' database web sites and from a jointly developed web site.</SMALL></p>
<HR>
<P><A HREF="http://image.llnl.gov/">I.M.A.G.E. Consortium</A></B> (Integrated Molecular Analysis of Genomes and their Expression) and 
<A HREF="http://genome.wustl.edu/est/mouse_esthmpg.html">WashU</A></B> (Washington University)
<P><SMALL>We work with the I.M.A.G.E. consortium to pre-assign MGI accession numbers to I.M.A.G.E. clones, which are, in turn, sequenced by Washington University.  The I.M.A.G.E. and MGI accession identifiers travel in pairs and are submitted to <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/index.html">dbEST</A> (database of Expressed Sequence Tags) directly with the sequencing data.  Thus the connection between an EST, the clone it was derived from, and the MGI accession identifier is generated.</SMALL></p>
<HR>
<P><A HREF="../nomen/">International Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice</A>,  
<A HREF="http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/">HUGO Human Gene Nomenclature Committee</A>, </B>and <A HREF="http://rgnc.gen.gu.se/">Rat Genome and Nomenclature Committee</A></B>. 
<P><SMALL>We work closely with the human and rat international nomenclature groups to assign gene symbols wherever feasible, to evaluate gene family nomenclature, and to maintain consistent use of nomenclature for human, mouse and rat species.</SMALL></p>
<HR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink/">LocusLink at NCBI</A></B>. (National Center for Biotechnology Information)
<P><SMALL>Working with LocusLink, we provide official nomenclature for mouse genes, our curated links between genes and sequence identifiers in <A HREF="http://www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/GenbankOverview.html">GenBank</a>, chromosomal, cytogenetic and centimorgan map positions, and MGI accession numbers.  LocusLink uses these curated data to develop reference sequences for mouse and notify us of new GenBank mouse sequences submitted.</SMALL></p>
<HR>
<P><A HREF="http://genex.hgu.mrc.ac.uk/">Mouse Atlas and 3D Graphical Gene Expression Database</A></B> 
<P><SMALL>We collaborate with the Edinburgh Mouse Atlas and Gene Expression Database project to develop and extend an anatomical dictionary of mouse development and to build the Mouse Gene Expression Information Resource that will combine the use of controlled vocabularies and image-based methods for the representation and analysis of expression patterns. The standard anatomical terms are, or will be, used throughout our database wherever anatomical data are found (e.g., expression data, clone library information, phenotypic descriptions).</SMALL></p>
<HR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.informatics.jax.org/ccr/searches/index.cgi">Mouse Chromosome Committees</A></B>
<P><SMALL>We host the Chromosome Committee Reports on our web site and have developed tools for the Committee Chairs to submit and update reports and files.  The Committees provide MGD with centimorgan positions from their evaluations of all available mapping data for their chromosome.  In addition, their reports present information on mapping methods, mutations,  human gene homologs, a narrative of new developments, and other files and graphics of interest.</SMALL></P>
<HR>
<P><a href="http://www.rarf.riken.go.jp/">RIKEN Institute of Physical and Chemical Research</a></b>
<p><small>We collaborate with the <a href="http://genome.rtc.riken.go.jp/index.html">Genome Exploration Research Group</a> of the RIKEN Institute in Japan to provide public access to RIKEN cDNAclone information through MGI. These clones were isolated and sequenced at the RIKEN Institute as part of a series of public cDNA clone releases that constitute the Mouse Genome Encyclopedia, a genomics project centered on the production of full-length mouse cDNAs. The RIKEN Institute hosted a meeting for first-pass functional annotation of the first set of 21,076 cDNAs (Functional Annotation of Mouse, FANTOM), attended by an international assembly of mammalian biologists and bioinformaticians. Links are provided to DNA Database of Japan (DDBJ) records and to analysis results and summary annotations from the FANTOM meeting for these RIKEN cDNA clones.</small></p>

<!--per mringwald, take GO off acknowledgements because they're collaborators<P><A HREF="http://www.geneontology.org" target="_top">GO Database</A> (Gene Ontology Database, GO Consortium)</p>
<P><small>The GO database provides controlled vocabularies for the description of the molecular function, biological process, and cellular component of gene products. Collaborating databases use these terms as attributes of gene products thus facilitating uniform queries. Databases external to GO collaborate with GO in three ways: first, by making database cross-links between GO terms and objects in their databases (typically, gene products, or their surrogates, genes), and then providing tables of these links to GO (and hence the community); second, by supporting queries that use these terms in their database; and third, by contributing to the development of the GO database itself, expanding the vocabularies and refining the terms.</small></P>-->
