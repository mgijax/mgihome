<h2>Overview of the Human-Mouse: Disease Connection</h2>

The goal is to pull together both human and mouse data into a single flexible tool which 
can be used to answer a variety of biological and especially disease-related questions 
<p>
This tool can be used to:
-	use information about known mouse phenotypes to prioritize candidate genes from a list (whole genome sequencing, exome sequencing)
-	use information about known mouse phenotypes to prioritize candidates within a region (QTLs, GWAS, association or family based studies)
-	identify mouse genes and genetic which have been annotated to a disease
-	identify mouse genes which are known to be involved within a specific biological system
-	find an experimental mouse model to use in the study of a specific human disease
