<h3><A HREF="http://www.geneontology.org" target="_top">Gene Ontology (GO) Database</A></h3>
<blockquote><cite> Gene Ontology Database, GO Consortium. </blockquote></cite>
<P>The GO database provides controlled vocabularies for the description of the molecular function, biological process, and cellular component of gene products. Collaborating databases use these terms as attributes of gene products thus facilitating uniform queries. Databases external to GO collaborate with GO in three ways: first, by making database cross-links between GO terms and objects in their databases (typically, gene products, or their surrogates, genes), and then providing tables of these links to GO (and hence the community); second, by supporting queries that use these terms in their database; and third, by contributing to the development of the GO database itself, expanding the vocabularies and refining the terms.</P>

<p>A collaboration with the Genome Exploration Research Group of the RIKEN Institute of Physical and Chemical Research in Japan provides public access to RIKEN cDNAclone information through MGI. These clones were isolated andsequenced at the RIKEN Institute as part of a series of public cDNA clone releases that constitute the Mouse Genome Encyclopedia, a genomics project centered on the production of full-length mouse cDNAs. The RIKEN Institute hosted a meeting for first-pass functional annotation of the first set of 21,076 cDNAs (Functional
Annotation of Mouse, FANTOM), attended by an international assembly of mammalian biologists and bioinformaticians. Links are provided to DNA Database of Japan (DDBJ) records and to analysis results and summary annotations from the FANTOM meeting for these RIKEN cDNA clones.</P>
