<blockquote><cite>
 Gene Ontology Database, GO Consortium.

</blockquote></cite>
The GO database provides controlled vocabularies 
for the description of the molecular function, biological process, and cellular component of gene 
products. Collaborating databases use these terms as attributes of gene products thus
facilitating uniform queries. Databases external to GO collaborate with GO in three ways: 
first, by making database cross-links between GO terms
and objects in their databases (typically, gene products, or their surrogates, genes), and then 
providing tables of these links to GO (and hence the community); second, 
by supporting queries that use these terms in their database; and 
third, by contributing to the development of the GO database itself, expanding the vocabularies 
and refining the terms.

RATMAP is a database covering genes physically mapped to chromosomes in the laboratory rat. In addition to
chromosomal localisation of genes and anonymous DNA sequences, RATMAP gives information about
methods and accuracy of localisation (Mode and Status) and a short description of the genes. Appropriate
literature references to each mapped rat gene are also given. Furthermore, RATMAP supports comparative
mapping to several species. At present, comparative mapping data is given for bovine, human and the mouse.

</blockquote></cite>

<p>The RIKEN Mouse Gene Encyclopaedia Project, a systematic approach to 
determining the full coding potential of the mouse genome, involves 
collection and sequencing of full-length complementary DNAs and physical 
mapping of the corresponding genes to the mouse genome. An international 
assembly of mammalian biologists and bioinformaticians --including a team from MGI--met in late summer, of
2000 at a functional annotation meeting (FANTOM) to annotate the first RIKEN collection. This set 
contains a group of 21,076 fully sequenced full-length mouse cDNAs; among 
them, 15,295 represent unique genes; it is one of the largest described 
and annotated in any organism to date. Analysis of these cDNAs extends known gene 
families and identifies new ones. -->


<!--
Participants at the FANTOM (Functional Annotation Of Mouse) meeting () 
established the international standard for annotations of full-length cDNAs; -covered not just 
functional information, but also supplemental descriptions of gene function (gene symbol and synonym),   
functional classification (Gene Ontology, and TIGR EGAD), chromosomal localization (from genetic 
mapping and physical mapping, if available), expression specificity (organ localization and 
sub-cellular localization of cDNA), and mutation information (disease and knockout mouse 
information).-->
