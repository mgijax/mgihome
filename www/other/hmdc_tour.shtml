<h2><font color="f7941e">The Human&#8211;Mouse&#58; Disease Connection</font></h2>

<p>The goal of the Human&#8211;Mouse&#58; Disease Connection (HMDC) is to provide seamless human-to-mouse 
data traversal, enabling clinical and translational researchers to take advantage of the wealth 
of data and annotations from mouse models; as well as allowing mouse researchers to connect 
their findings directly to genetic associations reported in human disease.</p>
<p>The mouse is genetically and physiologically similar to humans, is tractable as a 
laboratory animal, has a fully sequenced and well-annotated genome, and a readily available 
set of powerful molecular technologies for manipulating its genome in very precise ways. 
Now, clinical researchers whose primary focus is on human genetic disease, variants, and 
natural mutations have a highly-accessible way to explore experimentally characterized mouse 
mutants for a spectrum of associated phenotypes, as well as known disease models developed 
by the greater research community. Investigators can begin with genes (symbols, names or IDs) 
or gene lists, genome positions (as coordinates from human or mouse, or as <a href="http://www.1000genomes.org/node/101">.vcf</a>
 files), <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim">OMIM diseases</a> 
or phenotypes, and retrieve a list of genes, annotated mammalian phenotypes, associated human 
diseases and/or available mouse models for further research, along with comprehensive 
supporting references. If you are new to working with mouse models, or encounter terms 
which are unfamiliar to you, we also encourage you to browse the <a href="<!--#include file='include/mgihome_url.html'-->other/homepage_IntroMouse.shtml">
Introduction to Mouse Genetics</a> in order to aid with the interpretation of your results.</p>
<p>
<div id="whatcan">
<h3><font color="f7941e">What can you do with the HMDC?</font></h3>
<p>
This tool can be used to:
<ul>
	<li>prioritize candidate variants from whole genome sequencing based on previously reported
	 disease associations and observed phenotypes</li>
	<li>prioritize candidates within a genomic region (QTLs, GWAS, association or family based studies)</li>
	<li>identify mouse genes that exhibit a phenotype of interest</li>
	<li>identify human and mouse genetic associations to disease</li>
	<li>find an experimental mouse model to use in the study of a specific human disease</li>
</ul>

<div id="begin">
<h3><font color="f7941e">Beginning your search</font></h3>

<p>Entry into the HMDC is designed to be straightforward. On the homepage, three boxes appear 
where investigators may choose to enter (1) genes - either individually or multiples, (2) 
a genome location or set of genomic regions, and/or (3) disease name(s) or mammalian phenotype(s).

<ol>
	<li><font color="002255"><b>Searching genes:</b></font><br>
			Gene based queries will match official symbols, full gene names and synonyms in both human and 
			mice. An asterisk (&#42;) can be used as a wildcard in the prefix or suffix. 
			Separate multiple entries using commas, spaces or new lines. </li>
	<li><font color="002255"><b>Searching genome locations:</b></font><br>
			To search positions, please ensure that you are using the current genome 
			assembly (build) and have selecting the appropriate species using the radio 
			buttons above the search window. If you need to convert your data, a 
			<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/tools/remap#tab=asm">simple online 
			remapping tool has been provided by NCBI</a>. <font color="#F7941e"><b>Currently 
			only base pair (bp) positions are supported</font></b>, not megabase (Mb) or 
			linkage positions (i.e. centimorgans or band position). Separate multiple entries 
			using spaces, commas or new lines; please do not use commas within coordinate 
			positions as these will be misinterpreted as item separators for independent 
			genome locations.</li>
	<li><font color="002255"><b>Searching disease and phenotype terms:</b></font><br>
			Disease and phenotype terms may be searched using text-matching by simply 
			typing in the box, or you can take advantage of structured vocabulary by 
			selecting from the autocomplete list that appears. Multiple entries are 
			supported, results must match at least one term, but are not required to match 
			all terms. Use the filters once the grid has been generated to restrict your list.
			 The shaded grey text to the right of autocomplete terms indicates the vocabulary 
			 that an annotation applies to:
			<ul>
				<li><i><font color="grey">Mammalian Phenotype:</i></font> will match all 
					genes where a mouse model has been reported to exhibit this phenotype. 
					These are hierarchical, so selecting a broad general term will also 
					bring back genes annotated to more specific child terms. See the 
					<a href="<!--#include file='include/mgihome_url.html'-->../searches/MP_form.shtml">
					Mammalian Phenotype (MP) browser</a>.</li>
				<li><i><font color="grey">OMIM:</i></font> from the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim">
					Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man</a> database. Contains human diseases 
					with associated human genes and is cross-referenced externally and within 
					MGI for mouse genetic models of these human diseases. 
						<ul>
							<li>Some terms are very specific and may reference only a 
								subtype of the disease (ex. "Alzheimer disease, familial, 
								5"). In these cases, it may be preferable to use the 
								text-based matching without selecting an autocomplete value.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>		
			</ul>
			</li>
		<li><font color="002255"><b>Upload a vcf:</b></font><br>
			Variant call format (.vcf) file upload is also supported for phenotype and 
			disease annotation. This tool is not equipped to do functional analysis of 
			variants or filtering, so we recommend uploading a trimmed candidate list. 
			See <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/databases/exomiser/">
			Exomiser</a> for a filtering tool designed to process human data. The default is to discard all SNPs with a 
			known dbSNP identifier (rs&#35;). If you want to keep these genes in your results 
			clear the contents of the sixth column, but do not delete it, so as to preserve 
			standard column structure. See <a ref="#vcf">Section on vcf files</a> for more 
			information.</li>

<p>For many experimental questions, a single search box will be sufficient, but if two boxes 
have search terms entered, the results will reflect cases matching on both categories (boolean 
AND). While this can be an efficient shortcut, if a very precise phenotype or disease annotation 
is used, some potentially relevant results may be omitted.</p>
<p>Whichever search box is used, the same set of results tables will appear. To follow along
with this example, enter &ldquo;<i>trp53 proc apc cdkn2a</i>&rdquo; into the <b>Genes</b> search box (not 
case sensitive).

<p><h3><font color="f7941e">In this beta release...</font></h3>
The HMDC does not offer filtering or variant specific analyses in our initial release, 
but rather applies phenotype and disease terms to the genes and homologs which are represented. 
Note that this will return phenotypes associated with genes even if the SNP variant is 
benign. For this reason, we have set the default to filter out all variants that have a 
known rs:&#35; or other identifiers in column 3 (ID), as well as reject all variants that 
are not tagged as "PASS" in column 7 (FILTER). We also strongly 
encourage users to pre-filter by presumed functional impact or on the basis of linkage 
(where possible) using a tool such as <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/databases/exomiser/query/">Exomiser</a>.
These filters allow a phenotypic annotation to de novo, unreported (rare) or private 
gene variants. If your experimental design requires that known variants be included, you can 
bypass the ID filter by clearing column 3 in your uploaded file.</p>
<p>Maximum upload file size is 25MB. Only the first 100,000 lines will be processed.</p>
