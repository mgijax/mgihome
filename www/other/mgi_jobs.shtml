</UL>


<P><A NAME="sse"></a><h3>Scientific Software Engineers</h3></P>

<P>The Mouse Genome Informatics Group at The Jackson Laboratory has openings for scientific software engineers. Our group develops biological databases and software tools used worldwide by scientists and medical researchers who use the laboratory mouse to study genetics and human diseases.

<p>Applicants must be energetic, imaginative, and ready to participate in a highly interdisciplinary environment combining biology and computer science.  Desired skills include: Web site design and implementation (HTML, CGI, Java Servlet API, Java Applets), relational database programming (SQL, JDBC), GUI design and implementation, object-oriented design and programming, Perl, Python, Java, Sybase.  Excellent communication skills required.  Unix experience required, Windows and Mac experience helpful. B.S. in Computer Science required.  Strong interest in Biology preferred. Please refer to job posting #050/0T.</P>

<P><A NAME="biologists"></a><h3>Scientific Curators</h3></P>
<P>Professional positions are available as Scientific Curators in the expanding Mouse Genome Informatics Programs at The
Jackson Laboratory working with the Mouse Genome Database, Gene Expression Database, Mouse Sequence Database,
Gene Ontology Project and Rat Genome Database Collaboration. Successful candidates will be primarily responsible for data
acquisition and analysis, evaluating and annotating data to be incorporated into the databases, integrating information from
disparate sources, and interacting with research laboratories and genome centers to facilitate data transfer. In addition,
Curators take part in database and interface design by contributing biological perspectives to new data content and displays.
Specific areas of preferred expertise are detailed for each project below. Other desirable attributes include excellent writing /
communication skills and the ability to work effectively in a team environment. Ph.D. degree in Life Sciences or M.S. with
appropriate experience required.</P>
<UL>
 <LI><B>Mouse Genome Database (MGD) Project</B> - Applicants with strong backgrounds in mammalian genetics and comparative
genomics or in the use of mouse mutants as models of human disease preferred. MGD integrates a wide range mouse of genetic, genomic and phenotypic data, including gene characterization, gene localization and sequence, homologies and comparative mapping among mammals, phenotype characteristics, allelic variants and mutants, and strain data.</LI><br><br>
 <LI><B>Gene Expression Database (GXD) Project</B> - Applicants with strong backgrounds in molecular and developmental biology and anatomy preferred. GXD integrates different types of gene expression information from the laboratory mouse and places them in the larger biological and analytical context via integration with MGD and MGS and by curating links to many other resources. </LI><br><br>
<LI><B>Mouse Genome Sequence (MGS) Project</B> - Applicants with strong sequence and comparative genome analysis experience preferred. The goal of the MGS project is to integrate emerging mouse genomic sequence data with the genetic and biological data available in MGD and GXD. MGS supports the MouseBLAST server as a sequence-level entry point into the mouse database resources.</LI><br><br>
<LI><B>Gene Ontology (GO) Project</B> - Applicants with strong biochemistry and cell biology backgrounds and an interest in mammalian systems preferred. The GO project is a collaborative effort with scientists from other model organism databases to construct
biological ontologies for the annotation of gene and gene products and to use these resources in the mouse databases
resources.</LI><br><br>

<li><b>Mouse Tumor Biology Database (MTB) Project</b> - Applicants with strong backgrounds in tumor biology, cancer genetics, and mouse models preferred. MTB integrates data on frequency, incidence, genetics, and pathology of neoplastic disorders, emphasizing data on tumors that develop characteristically in different genetically defined strains of mice. </li><br><br>

<LI><B>Rat Genome Database (RGD) Collaboration</B> - Applicants with strong backgrounds in mammalian genetics and comparative genomics preferred. RGD is a genomics database developed at the Medical College of Wisconsin to support the rat as a model organism. Our role in this collaboration includes establishing new rat gene nomenclature and curating gene orthology data for rat, mouse, and human.</LI>
