<P><A NAME="biologists"></a><h3>Scientific Curators</h3></P>
<P>Professional positions are available as Scientific Curators in the expanding Mouse Genome Informatics Programs at The Jackson Laboratory working with the Mouse Genome Database, Gene Expression Database, <!--Mouse Sequence Database,
Gene Ontology Project,--> Mouse Tumor Biology Database, and Rat Genome Database Collaboration. Successful candidates will be primarily responsible for data acquisition and analysis, evaluating and annotating data to be incorporated into the databases, integrating information from disparate sources, and interacting with research laboratories and genome centers to facilitate data transfer. In addition, Curators take part in database and interface design by contributing biological perspectives to new data content and displays. Specific areas of preferred expertise are detailed below for available positions.  Other desirable attributes include excellent writing / communication skills and the ability to work effectively in a team environment. Ph.D. degree in Life Sciences or M.S. with appropriate experience required.</P>
<UL>
 <LI><B>Mouse Genome Database (MGD) Project</B> - Applicants with strong backgrounds in mammalian genetics and comparative
genomics or in the use of mouse mutants as models of human disease preferred. MGD integrates a wide range mouse of genetic, genomic, and phenotypic data including gene characterization, gene localization and sequence, homologies and comparative mapping among mammals, phenotype characteristics, allelic variants and mutants, and strain data.<br>

<i>Current needs are for individuals with mouse genetics, immunology, development, or phenotyping backgrounds. Experience and/or knowledge of genetic engineering techniques in mouse preferred.</i>
