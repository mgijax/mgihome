<h3><A NAME="biologists"></a>Scientific Curators</h3>
<p>Professional positions are available as Scientific Curators in the Mouse Genome Informatics programs at The Jackson Laboratory working with the Mouse Genome Database, the Mouse Tumor Biology Database, and the Knockout Mouse Project Database. Successful candidates will be primarily responsible for data acquisition and analysis, evaluating and annotating data to be incorporated into the databases, integrating information from disparate sources, and interacting with research laboratories and genome centers to facilitate data transfer. In addition, curators take part in database and interface design by contributing biological perspectives to new data content and display. Specific areas of preferred expertise are detailed below for available positions. Other desirable attributes include excellent writing / communication skills and the ability to work effectively in a team environment. Ph.D. degree in Life Sciences required; exceptional individuals with M.S. degrees and extensive experience will be considered. A cover letter should be submitted with your resume.
</p>
<p>Positions are currently open in the:
<ul>
  <li><u>Mouse Genome Database (MGD) Project</u> - Applicants should have a strong background in mammalian genetics, comparative genomics, or in the use of mouse mutants as models of human disease. Knowledge of genetic engineering techniques, immunology, disease-specific areas, and embryonic development preferred. MGD integrates a wide range of mouse genetic, genomic, and phenotypic data, including gene characterization, gene localization and sequence, homologies and comparative mapping among mammals, phenotype characteristics, allelic variants and mutants, and strain data.</li><br>

<li><u>Mouse Tumor Biology Database (MTB) Project</u> - Applicants with strong backgrounds in tumor biology, cancer genetics, and mouse models preferred. MTB integrates data on frequency, incidence, genetics, and pathology of neoplastic disorders, emphasizing data on tumors that characteristically develop in different genetically-defined strains of mice.</li><br>

 <!--<li><u>Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) Data Coordination Center</u> - Applicants should have a strong background in gene annotation and analysis based on biological data. Knowledge of knockout and gene trap techniques and gene nomenclature preferred. KOMP is a trans-NIH initiative to generate a public resource of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells containing a null mutation in every gene in the mouse genome. The KOMP Data Coordination Center serves as a clearinghouse for information about the progress of the KOMP project and as an information resource about publicly available knockout mutants.</li>-->
