<h1>Introduction to Mouse Genetics</h1>

<div id="templateBodyInsert">

<p>
Mouse genetics has experienced many milestones over the last few decades, from
the generation of inbred lines which consistently exhibited a coat color trait
or susceptibility to tumors in the early 1900s, up to routine gene manipulation,
conditional targeting and whole genome sequencing or transcript profiling of
individuals.  As an experimental system, the mouse has allowed incredible insight
into gene function, dissection of gene-disease relationships and a wealth of other
data.</p>

		<td valign="top"><p>The study of genetics in it&#8217;s most basic form is the study of
			genes. What they are, where they are, how they work, how they differ and how
			this forms the basis of inherited traits. Inherited traits include metabolic
			activity, disease susceptibility, body patterning, hair color, blood type and
			more.</p>
			<p>The code for these traits resides in an organism's DNA. When a gene is
			activated, the DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) which is then
			translated into protein. The regulation of gene activation is controlled by
			transcription factors which can bind to non-coding promoter or enhancer
			elements. These recruit RNA polymerases and other factors to the
			transcriptional start site, which copy the sequence into a new molecule. The
			regions of the gene that will eventually code for protein are called exons
			and are spliced together with introns removed as part of mRNA processing. The
			canonical splice site consensus sequence in pre-mRNA uses "CAG&#124; G" for
			the 3' donor and "MAG &#124; GTRAGT" for the 5' splice site acceptor, where M
			is A or C and R is A or G. Additional post-transcriptional regulation may
			also occur by non-coding microRNAs (miRNA), small interfering RNAs (siRNA),
			small nuclear or nucleolar RNAs (snRNA and snoRNA), or other processes. mRNA
			is capped, polyadenylated and exported from the nucleus to the ribosomes,
			where it is translated into protein.

			<p>Within a species, all members carry the same set of genes,
		or functional units. The mouse reference genome contains an estimated
		<a href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/homepages/stats/all_stats.shtml#allstats_ortho">
		22,958 protein-coding genes</a> and was fully sequenced in 2002 <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12466850">
		(Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium <i>et al.</i>, 2002, Nature)</a>. Structurally,
		these are distributed across 19 pairs of autosomes, plus X and Y sex chromosomes.
		For the sake of comparison, humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes (22 autosomes
		plus XX or XY) which contain an estimated 20,687 protein-coding genes
		<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v489/n7414/full/nature11247.html">
		(The ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012, Nature)</a>. Over 90% of the mouse and
		human genomes can be aligned into regions of shared synteny, which is to say,
		blocks where homologous genes are conserved in the same relative order,
		indicative of shared common ancestry. At the gene level, a mouse homolog has
		been identified and classified for <a href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/homepages/stats/all_stats.shtml#Vertebrate_Homology">
		17,096</a> human genes.</p>
			<p>Variability between individuals within a species is due to variant gene
		forms called alleles. Some changes are able to alter the expression or function
		of genes resulting in observable phenotypic differences, such as coat color,
		disease resistance/susceptibility, or metabolism but many other alleles result in
		little to no detectable variation beyond the sequence level. Variant alleles may
		include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions and deletions (indels),
		or copy number variation (CNVs). In the case of laboratory model organisms,
		targeted alleles also exist where genetic engineering techniques have been used
		to specifically alter, delete or introduce DNA sequences. A single gene may have
		multiple alleles with different biological consequences, and every allele in MGI
		is given a unique identifier, which is appended to the gene symbol as a superscript.
		See the section below on Nomenclature for more.</p>
			<p>Barring the unusual case of chimeras, every nucleated cell in a mouse&#8217;s
		body carries the same DNA code. However, different gene expression patterns allow
		these cells to develop into a variety of tissues and organs, as well as respond
		to stimuli. The <a href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/expression.shtml">Gene
		Expression Database</a> at MGI allows you to search for genes which are expressed
		in different mouse anatomical structures, with a particular emphasis on embryonic
		development.</p>
			<p>The end result, whether a single measurement or the composite of all of
		an individual's observable or measurable traits is called the phenotype. In MGI,
		phenotypes are annotated to the complete genotype, which is comprised of both the
		allele(s) of special interest as well as the background. Just as different
		specific alleles may be expected to have different characteristics and biological
		impacts (consider missense coding variants versus knockout alleles versus
		conditional or reporter targeted alleles), other alleles in the strain background,
		whether known or unknown, can have modifier effects on a trait, or set of traits.
		For example, the <a href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/allele/key/568">
		<i>Lep<sup>ob</sup></i> allele</a> shows background sensitivity with homozygous
		<i>Lep<sup>ob</sup>/Lep<sup>ob</sup></i> <a href="http://jaxmice.jax.org/strain/000632.html">
		on a C57BL/6J background</a> exhibiting severe obesity with a pre-diabetes-like
		syndrome, while <i>Lep<sup>ob</sup>/Lep<sup>ob</sup></i>
		<a href="http://jaxmice.jax.org/strain/000696.html">on a C57BLKS background</a> become
		severely diabetic and infertile in addition to obese, with a significantly shortened

<h2>Inbred Strains</h2>

<p>To begin understanding mouse model genetics, it is important to begin at the roots
&#45; inbred lines. An inbred strain is one in which mice have been carefully bred
either brother&#45;sister or parent&#45;progeny over a minimum of 20 sequential
generations to produce a line which is genetically and phenotypically consistent. Most
laboratory strains are now several hundreds of generations inbred. Within an inbred
mouse strain, all individuals have the same genotype and are homozygous (carry a single
allelic variant) at all loci. Members of an inbred strain are essentially genetic
clones of one another, which allows good experimental reproducibility for genetically
influenced traits, guaranteeing a consistent and uniform animal model for study, even
across multiple generations or different laboratories.</p>

<p>While all mice are genetically homogenous within a specific inbred line, different
inbred lines will carry a different set of fixed alleles and exhibit different phenotypic
characteristics as a result. Choosing the right inbred strain for a particular
experiment or control is an important consideration when working with laboratory mice.</p>
<p>Having a well characterized and consistent background is also a valuable tool
when it comes to examining the effects of a <a href="#targeted">targeted allele</a> or
manipulation. By comparing the phenotype of the targeted line to its parental strain,
it is possible to determine the which biological systems have been affected and draw
inferences about the function of the single, modified gene.</p>
<p>Inbred strains are given names to identify the specific genetic background. These
names are composed of a combination of capital letters and/or numbers and may also have
substrain designations (letters or numbers following a forward slash) and&#45;or lab
codes to indicate where the strain is being maintained. See the nomenclature tutorial
video, or browse the <a href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen/index.shtml">Full

<h2>Targeted Alleles</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, one of the advantages of inbred strains in genetic research is
that they provide a stable framework to study the role a single gene by using mutants
or knockout alleles. Unlike in population-based studies in humans where many genetic
factors are segregating, a new, known mutation on a predictable background allows
researchers to attribute new phenotypes to that specific gene and draw inferences about
it&#8217;s normal function. Because a stable, predictable  background is required, mutant
phenotypes in MGI are attributed to the complete genotype of a mouse (specific allele
on a defined inbred background). Many mutant alleles exhibit the same phenotype
regardless of background, but others have altered penetrance or display a range of
phenotypes in a background-dependent fashion as a result of other pathway modifiers.</p>

<p>One of the most useful aspects of the mouse as an experimental genetic model
is this ability to easily generate targeted alleles. The canonical targeted allele is a
gene knockout, where all or part of the coding region of a targeted gene is replaced
by a selection cassette, completely eliminating function. This is achieved by introducing
 a vector engineered to contain homologous sequences on either side of the targeting
cassette into embryonic stem (ES) cells. The cellular machinery within a cell pairs the
vector&#8217;s homologous arms to the mouse&#8217;s endogenous sequence and if recombination occurs
on both sides, the cassette will be introduced into the germ line. These ES cells can
be selected and transplanted back into a pseudopregnant female mouse where they will grow
and develop. The illustration in <i>(C)</i> shows a heterozygous targeted allele.</p>

</div>

<div id=homologous>

<div id="figure4">

		<img style="padding:6px" src="images/intro_homologous.jpg" alt="homologous recombination" border="1">
		<figcaption><p><b>Figure 4. Generation of targeted alleles by homologous
			recombination.</b> Targeted alleles of all kinds can be generated in
			embryonic stem cells by taking advantage of the normal processes of
			homologous recombination in the cell. <b><i>(A)</i></b> First, a targeting
			vector is constructed which contains the cassette to be introduced
			(engineered cassette) flanked both upstream and downstream with DNA sequences
			that match perfectly (i.e. are homologous) to the upstream and downstream
			regions around the endogenous gene or region an investigator wants to replace.
			In the case of a knockout allele, typically the engineered cassette will
			replace coding exons with a selectable marker such as a neomycin resistance
			gene (NEO cassette) to facilitate selection and enrichment of positive ES
			cell clones. Often a negative selection marker will be built into the vector
			downstream of the homologous region to allow screening against incomplete
			(single arm) or random recombinations. <b><i>(B)</i></b> The targeting vector
			is introduced into the nucleus of a pluripotent embryonic stem cell, where
			the homologous arms match up with their matching sequences in the endogenous
			gene. In a process similar to what occurs during meiosis, the aligned regions
			cross over, incorporating the engineered construct into the endogenous locus
			and removing the enclosed endogenous sequence.
			<b><i>(C)</i></b> The complete, properly targeted cell now has the engineered
			construct in it&#8217;s germ line in place of the reference sequence. ES cells can
			be screened for proper targeting using the selectable markers, sequencing,
			and/or Southern blotting, then positive clones can be grown to blastocysts
			and implanted in a pseudopregnant recipient mouse where they will develop as
			embryos.</p>

<p>This same strategy can also be used to introduce specific new variation into a mouse.
This may be a single, specific engineered substitution designed to duplicate a mutation
found in human clinical cases (ex. <a href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/allele/key/56294">
M390R in Bbs1<sup>tm1Vcs</sup></a>), a recombinase recognition sequence to allow <i>in
vivo</i> genome manipulation, or the introduction of a complete cDNA from another species,
which is known as a transgene.</p>

		<figcaption>
	  	<b><p>Figure 4. Four of the most common targeted allele types:</b> The top
	  	row depicts the endogenous (or unaltered) allele where exons are properly spliced
	  	(see dashed lines) and a full length, functional protein is produced. Below,
	  	 a knock-out allele (KO) uses homologous recombination to replace certain
	  	functional exons with a targeting cassette containing a selectable marker. This
	  	gene is no longer able to produce a functional protein. A <a href="#cre">conditionally
	  	targeted allele</a>, also commonly referred to as "floxed" for "flanked by LoxP"
	  	introduces recombinase recognizable sequences both upstream and downstream of
	  	the targeted exons. When no recombinase enzymes are expressed, these genes
	  	function as normal; however, if the correct recombinase is expressed within the
	  	same cell (illustrated with the scissors), it is able to act on these sites and
	  	produce an altered allele, most commonly excising the exon for a truncated,
	  	non-functional protein. For a reporter allele, a cassette is introduced which
	  	contains a detectable marker, commonly a fluorescent tag or lacZ gene which can
	  	be visualized under a microscope. These are often used to detect patterns of gene
	  	expression as the marker will indicate when the target promoter has been

<div id="cre">
<h2>Conditional Alleles and the cre-Lox System</h2>

<p>For many genes, a complete null allele can have very serious consequences for
embryonic development or viability. As well, investigators may often wish to examine
the role of a gene exclusively in the context of a particular organ system or cell
type without causing abnormalities elsewhere. Site-specific recombinase technology
can be used to efficiently cause deletions, translocations and inversions in genomic
DNA with high fidelity when a genome-remodeling recombinase enzyme is co-expressed.
By restricting expression of the recombinase to specific tissues or cell lineages &#45;
or by placing it under the control of a drug-inducible promoter &#45; the genome
remodeling can also be restricted to specific tissues or time points.</p>
<p>The most commonly used system in laboratory mice is called "cre-lox" which involves
the cre recombinase enzyme, originally cloned from the P1 bacteriophage, and recombinase
recognition sites referred to as "loxP sites" (locus of X&#45;over P1). LoxP
sites are 32 base pair consensus sequences with an 8-base core and two inverted repeats.</p>

<p>
	<blockquote><FONT FACE="courier">ATAACTTCGTATA<B>GCATACAT</B>TATACGAAGTTAT&#9658;</FONT>
	</blockquote></p>

<p>The inverted repeats give the loxP site the capacity for directionality. If the two
flanking loxP sites (upstream and downstream of the target) are oriented in the same
direction, the floxed segment will be excised along with one of the loxP repeats (as shown
in Figure 5), if the loxP sites are opposite orientations (facing each other), the segment
will be inverted, and if the loxP sites are located on different chromosomes (a <i>trans</i>
arrangement), the recombinase will mediate chromosomal translocations. A single loxP site
can not be manipulated by cre recombinase.
