<p>The estimates below are based on information in <i>Biology
of the Laboratory Mouse</i> by The Staff of the Jackson Laboratory (E. Green,
ed. 1966. Dover Publications, New York). <P>
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Strain variation can affect
these values significantly.
<p><b><U>General</U></b>
<br><b>Body weight:</b> average ~20 g; highly variable
(See also the growth charts for selected strains at <a href="http://jaxmice.jax.org/library/notes/457a.html">Animal Resources Body Weight Study of 1993</a>.  Similar information appears in pdf format in the following file: <a href="http://jaxmice.jax.org/library/charts/bodyweights.pdf">Body Weights for Selected Strains of JAX Mice</a>).
<br><b>Body Temperature:</b> ~36.9 C (in addition to strain, variables are age, sex, environmental conditions)
<br><b>Lifespan:</b> 1.3 - 3 years; highly variable
<p><b><U>Reproduction</U></b>
<br><b>Sexual maturity: </b>after ~4 weeks of age; highly variable
<br><b>Estrus cycle frequency:</b> every ~4-5 days
<br><b>Gestation:</b> Average 19-21 days
<br><b>Litter size:</b> usually 1-10 pups - highly variable due to genetic
and environmental factors; tends to increase for the first few litters,
then decrease with age
<br><b>Reproductive lifespan of a female:</b> approaches 2 years in some
strains
<br><b>Lactation:</b> duration ~4 weeks
<p><b><U>Circulation</U></b>
<br><b>Total serum protein:</b> ~4-7 g/100 ml
<br><b>Blood volume:</b> ~5.5 ml per 100 g
body weight
<br><b>Heart rate:</b> Adult: 632 +/- 51.3 beats per minute; Newborn:
286 +/- 56.8 beats per minute
<br><b>Systolic pressure:</b> 83-164 mm Hg
<br><b>Blood pH:</b> 7.3-7.4
<p><b><U>Respiration</U></b>
<br><b>Respiratory rate:</b> ~163 per minute
<br><b>Tidal volume:</b> ~0.15 ml
<p><b><U>Urinary Tract</U></b>
<br><b>Average urine output:</b> ~1.6 ml per 24 hr
<br><b>Average water intake:</b> ~ 5 ml per
24 hr
