<H2>Mouse Genome Informatics Chronology</H2>

<EM><B>1980s</EM></B><br>
Jackson Laboratory scientists produced the first on-line resource for mouse 
genetic information, the <EM>Genomic Database of the Mouse (GBASE)</EM> consisting 
of gene and mapping data (LOCUSBASE), and a strain-by-locus MATRIX.<P>

By the late 1980s a number of additional databases had been developed to 
fill specific research needs and were used in-house for data analysis and 
to produce periodic publications.  These included Mouse Linkage Database 
and Programs (MLDP), Probes and PCR databases describing molecular reagents 
and polymorphisms (MusProb and MusPCR), and Homology Database and Programs 
(HMDP) containing gene homology information between the mouse and other 
 mammalian species.
<P>
<EM><B>1989</EM></B><BR>
The <EM>Encyclopedia of the Mouse Genome</EM>, a suite of software tools for browsing
mouse genetic data and displaying genetic and cytogenetic maps, was
developed under SunView.  The <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> software was nominated, and
achieved finalist status, for a Computerworld Smithsonian Award for
Innovation in Information Technology in 1992. This project was the
predecessor to the current Mouse Genome Informatics Project.
<P>
<EM><B>1991</EM></B><BR>
The Mouse Locus Catalog (MLC), a synoptic descriptions of genes with 
bibliographic citations, was added to the GBASE on-line system.
<P> 

<EM><B>1992</EM></B><br>
The Mouse Genome Informatics Group was organized with the goal to develop a Mouse 
Genome Database that would combine all of the earlier disparate databases 
into one coherent system, eliminating redundancy and making possible new data 
integration and analysis.  The data would be accessible to the research community 
and the user interface would provide easy-to-use query options and tools for display, analysis, and reporting.
<P>
<EM><B>April 1994</EM></B><br>
The <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> application was revised for the UNIX platform and a  
version created for the Macintosh. The new <EM>Encyclopedia</EM>
incorporated innovations in data file structure as well as new display features 
and options.
<P>
<EM><B>June 1994</EM></B><br>

MGD 1.0 was released on the World Wide Web (WWW).  This first version incorporated 
all the data sets from GBASE, MLC, MLDP, HMDP, MusProb and MusPCR. The user interface presented query forms for all of these data sets.
<P>
<EM><B>February 1995</EM></B><BR>
The Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research mouse genetic maps 
(6252 mouse microsatellite repeats markers mapped on a C57BL/6J-<I>Lep<SUP>ob</I></SUP> x CAST 
F2 intercross) with their associated PCR primers and polymorphisms were 
incorporated into MGD.
<P> 

<EM><B>June 1995</EM></B><br>
The first MGD Mirror Site became available in the UK. The Mouse Genome 
Database was nominated for a Computerworld Smithsonian Award for Innovation 
in Information Technology in 1995.

<EM><B>July 1995</EM></B><br>
MGD Release 2.0 went on-line. This release included a new PostScript Map 
tool for generating map files for printing and a new display for viewing 
composite RI strain distribution patterns.  New data sets included a 
searchable version of Michael Festing's listing of inbred strains. In addition, 
abstracts for bibliographic records were included. 
<P>
<EM><B>November 1995</EM></B><br>
MGD Release 3.0 went on-line. This release included a new linkage map tool 
providing options to generate maps from MGD queries using homology, phenotype, 
and other search parameters, and display maps derived from various data sets. 
Community DNA Mapping Panel data sets from NCI-Frederick, EUCIB, The 
Jackson Laboratory and M. Seldin were added to MGD. MGD query forms were enhanced. 
<P>
<EM><B>February 1996</EM></B><br>
MGD Release 3.1 went on-line. Highlights of this release included a 
reorganization of the WWW presentation, with Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) 
serving as an umbrella for two database projects: the Mouse 
Genome Database (MGD), and the Gene Expression Database (GXD). 
The <EM>GXD Index</EM>, a searchable index of research reports documenting endogenous gene expression during mouse development, became available. An <EM>Oxford 
Grid</EM> display tool to compare the genomes of two species for homology was 
added to the MGD Mammalian Homology query form.  A "mini-map" display, showing the 
approximate location of a marker on a genetic map, was added to the detailed record 
display for a genetic marker. The 1995 Chromosome Committee Reports were 
released on-line.  A new form for querying the underlying Sybase schema was 
made available.
<P>
<EM><B>April 1996</EM></B><BR>
An upgrade of the Macintosh version of the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> of the Mouse Genome 
</EM>enabled Netscape to be configured to interact with the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM>.  Users 
could now retrieve genetic information from MGD by selecting a symbol in 
the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> map display.  A new mirror site was added in Japan.
<P> 
<EM><B>June 1996</EM></B><BR>

linkage maps for display on a Web page.  A cytogenetic map display was 
developed.  A new <EM>RFLP/PCR Polymorphisms</EM> query form allowed users to 
retrieve polymorphisms associated with specified strains or markers. A 
listing of rat strain characteristics was incorporated into Michael 
Festing's listing of mouse strains. The 1997 Chromosome Committee Reports 
were released on-line.  New community DNA Mapping Panel data sets from 
C. Kozak and R. Reeves were added.
<P>

<EM><B>February 1998</EM></B><br>
MGI 1.0 was released as a resource comprising MGD, GXD and related software
and data. The MGI web presentation was reorganized to highlight the integrated
access to biological data. A new query form, "cDNA and EST Expression," provides the
ability to search for expression information related to origin (tissue, age, cell line) and
specified genes. The "Query Menu" was introduced to provide quick access
to MGI query forms while a new set of data menus highlights the biological data 
content of MGI. 
<P> 
<EM><B>June 1998</EM></B><BR>
