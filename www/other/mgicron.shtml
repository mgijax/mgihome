<dd>MGI launches the <a href="<!--#include file='include/mgihome_url.html'-->homepages/humanDisease.shtml">Human&mdash;Mouse: Disease Connection</a>. This resource provides a path into mouse genetic and comparative data from the human or mouse perspective. Users can begin to explore data by searching for genes (symbols, names, IDs) or genome locations from human or mouse, or by searching with mouse phenotype or human disease terms. Searching also can be done using VCF file input for human or mouse data. </dd>

<dd>For the MGI 5.14 release, the Gene Expression Database (GXD) has simplified the ability to search for genes that are expressed in some anatomical structures but not others and/or in some developmental stages but not others. The ability to view and search for its expression images is also easier. The MGI Cre Portal is updated with the ability to search for recombinase activity in tissues via an autocomplete search field of structures from the Mouse Anatomical Dictionary. Recombinase allele detail pages have an improved summary of driver tissue activity and show both ages and structures where activity was detected/not detected. MGI SNP data are updated to NCBI dbSNP Build 137 and use the GRCm38.p1 build genome coordinates. MGI now includes over 100,000,000 RefSNPs. </dd>

<dd>MGI 3.0 integrates all mouse sequences from GenBank, RefSeq, the public mouse genome assembly, and the TIGR, DoTS, and NIA mouse gene indices with the rich biological knowledge represented for mouse genes and strains already in MGI. Information about the source of the sequences, such as strain, tissue, and library (for clone sequences) is carefully translated into controlled vocabularies to ensure accurate and complete query results. Details about sequences, such as length, type, strain, and provider descriptions, appear on gene detail and sequence summary pages. We provide a new Mouse Sequence Query Form for finding sequences in MGI using biological attributes of genes. Users can download some or all of the sequences associated with a gene or marker in MGI in FASTA format directly or forward them to the MouseBLAST sequence similarity server at MGI.</dd>

<dd>MGI 2.97 features enhancements to our Gene Expression Database(GXD)and include two new query forms: the Gene Expression Data Expanded Query Form form lets you search for genes expressed in some anatomical structures and/or developmental stages but not in others; the Anatomical Dictionary Browser Query Refiner form lets you narrow your searches by entering additional parameters, based upon expression results from the standard Mouse Anatomical Dictionary Browser form. Access to the Query Refiner is from an Anatomical Browser Term Detail page.</dd>
