<p><em><b>December 8, 2003</b></em></td>
MGI 2.98 consists simply of general enhancements and bug fixes.

<p><em><b>November 5, 2003</b></em></td>
MGI 2.97 features enhancements to our Gene Expression Database(GXD)and include two new query forms: the Gene Expression Data Expanded Query Form form lets you search for genes expressed in some anatomical structures and/or developmental stages but not in others; the Anatomical Dictionary Browser Query Refiner form lets you narrow your searches by entering additional parameters, based upon expression results from the standard Mouse Anatomical Dictionary Browser form. Access to the Query Refiner is from an Anatomical Browser Term Detail page.
 

<p><EM><B>May 22, 2003</B></EM><BR>
MGI 2.96 adds an Adult Mouse Anatomical Dictionary Browser to our collection of vocabulary browsers, includes the ability to query by Interpro terms or by RIKEN and IMAGE clone collections on our forms, and provides links to the Protein Database (PDB) from our gene detail pages.
<br><br>

<p><EM><B>April 1, 2003</B></EM><BR>
MGI 2.95 introduced an option for searching for markers by nomenclature. Results appear as a list of matches on any current symbol or name, allele symbol or name, withdrawn symbol or name, synonym, human ortholog symbol, human ortholog name, or other ortholog. Users can quickly determine whether a desired item is on the list  or see how to alter a search term to narrow the query. A new Mammalian Phenotype Browser lets users find synonyms or structures associated with phenotype categories; they can either use the vocabulary to annotate genes or use the descriptive terms as search criteria for finding genes. The release also included a a user survey form in an effort to improve MGI resources. Query Form Help appears as answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).

<p><EM><B>December 2002</B></EM><BR>
 MGI 2.9 presented an entirely new look and feel for our Web pages. A new search tool enables users to quickly find any gene symbol or name, accession ID, reference abstract, phenotype, gene expression data, Gene Ontology (GO) term, Anatomical Dictionary structure, Festing strain characteristic, or Mouse Locus Catalog (MLC) text contained in our database. We have redesigned our Gene Detail page to encompass more information. MGI marker records now link to Ensembl mouse gene model; we also obtain chromosome map locations for MGI genes associated with Ensembl gene models. MGI marker records also link to computationally derived transcript assemblies from the Database of Transcribed Sequence (DoTS) as well as from the Mouse Gene Index developed at The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR).
 
<p><EM><B>March 2002</B></EM><BR>
 MGI 2.8 presented phenotype classification terms for locating alleles that produce a particular phenotype. The GO Browser was enhanced: users can query Gene Ontology terms by structure in MGI and see a hierarchical return of gene records annotated to that structure as well as its substructures. The release also included an electronic version of Lee Silver's <i>Mouse Genetics</i>.

<p><EM><B>May 2001</B></EM><BR>
 MGI 2.7 consisted largely of enhancements to the Alleles Query Form and to the Phenotypic
Alleles Query Results Summary and Detail pages. On the form, there is a new search field for promoter notes. The summary and detail pages now display ES cell line associations, links to gene expression in genotypes with a given allele, and additional references.

<p><EM><B>February 2001</B></EM><BR>
 MGI 2.6 included MGD links to Locus Link, RefSeq, and Interpro databases; a Your Input Welcome 
 button for sending marker or allele corrections to User Support; new rules and guidelines for genes, 
 alleles, and mutation nomenclature; and links from the MGI Help documentation to the glossary.

<p><EM><B>October 2000</B></EM><BR>
 MGI 2.5 included the GO and Mouse Anatomy Dictionary vocabulary browsers, whole genome maps of 
 conserved regions for human and rat plotted against mouse chromosomes, and an expanded glossary 
 linked to MGI Help documentation.<!-- and a form and rules for submitting new allele and mutant data, 
 which was part of a "special" MGI Home release on 11/8/00, just before the IMGC meeting -->

<P><EM><B>May 2000</B></EM><BR>
 MGI 2.4 was released with the first use of Gene Ontology (GO) vocabularies to annotate genes. Allele 
 information now stored independently of phenotypic descriptions and searchable by an Alleles query 
 form.  Marker symbol and names fields combined into a single field on various MGI query forms.

<P><EM><B>April 2000</EM></B><BR>

 as new display features and options.

<P><EM><B>1992</EM></B><br>
 The Mouse Genome Informatics Group was organized with the goal to develop a Mouse Genome Database 
 that would combine all of the earlier disparate databases into one coherent system, eliminating 
 redundancy and making possible new data integration and analysis.  The data would be accessible to 
 the research community and the user interface would provide easy-to-use query options and tools for 
 display, analysis, and reporting.

<P><EM><B>1991</EM></B><BR>
The Mouse Locus Catalog (MLC), a synoptic descriptions of genes with 
bibliographic citations, was added to the GBASE on-line system.

<P><EM><B>1989</EM></B><BR>
 The <EM>Encyclopedia of the Mouse Genome</EM>, a suite of software tools for browsing mouse genetic 
 data and displaying genetic and cytogenetic maps, was developed under SunView.  The 
 <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> software was nominated, and achieved finalist status, for a Computerworld 
 Smithsonian Award for Innovation in Information Technology in 1992. This project was the predecessor 
 to the current Mouse Genome Informatics Project.
 
<p><EM><B>1980s</EM></B><br>
 Jackson Laboratory scientists produced the first on-line resource for mouse genetic information, the 
 <EM>Genomic Database of the Mouse (GBASE)</EM> consisting of gene and mapping data (LOCUSBASE), and 
 a strain-by-locus MATRIX.<P>

 By the late 1980s a number of databases had been developed to fill specific research needs 
 and were used in-house for data analysis and to produce periodic publications.  These included Mouse 
 Linkage Database and Programs (MLDP), Probes and PCR databases describing molecular reagents and 
 polymorphisms (MusProb and MusPCR), and Homology Database and Programs (HMDP) containing gene 
 homology information between the mouse and other mammalian species.
