<P><EM><B>June 2, 2004</B></EM><BR>
MGI 3.0 integrates all mouse sequences from GenBank, RefSeq, the public mouse genome assembly, and the TIGR, DoTS, and NIA mouse gene indices with the rich biological knowledge represented for mouse genes and strains already in MGI. Information about the source of the sequences, such as strain, tissue, and library (for clone sequences) is carefully translated into controlled vocabularies to ensure accurate and complete query results. 
Details about sequences, such as length, type, strain, and provider descriptions, appear on gene detail and sequence summary pages. We provide a new Mouse Sequence Query Form for finding sequences in MGI using biological attributes of genes. Users can download some or all of the sequences associated with a gene or marker in MGI in FASTA format directly or forward them to the MouseBLAST sequence similarity server at MGI.</P>

<P><EM><B>December 11, 2003</B></EM><BR>
MGI 2.98 consists of performance enhancements and bug fixes.</P>

<P><EM><B>November 5, 2003</B></EM><BR>
MGI 2.97 features enhancements to our Gene Expression Database(GXD)and include two new query forms: the Gene Expression Data Expanded Query Form form lets you search for genes expressed in some anatomical structures and/or developmental stages but not in others; the Anatomical Dictionary Browser Query Refiner form lets you narrow your searches by entering additional parameters, based upon expression results from the standard Mouse Anatomical Dictionary Browser form. Access to the Query Refiner is from an Anatomical Browser Term Detail page.</P>
 

<P><EM><B>May 22, 2003</B></EM><BR>
MGI 2.96 adds an Adult Mouse Anatomical Dictionary Browser to our collection of vocabulary browsers, includes the ability to query by Interpro terms or by RIKEN and IMAGE clone collections on our forms, and provides links to the Protein Database (PDB) from our gene detail pages.</P>


<P><EM><B>April 1, 2003</B></EM><BR>
MGI 2.95 introducs an option for searching for markers by nomenclature. Results appear as a list of matches on any current symbol or name, allele symbol or name, withdrawn symbol or name, synonym, human ortholog symbol, human ortholog name, or other ortholog. Users can quickly determine whether a desired item is on the list  or see how to alter a search term to narrow the query. A new Mammalian Phenotype Browser lets users find synonyms or structures associated with phenotype categories; they can either use the vocabulary to annotate genes or use the descriptive terms as search criteria for finding genes. The release also includes a user survey form in an effort to improve MGI resources. Query Form Help is formatted as answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).</P>

<P><EM><B>December 2002</B></EM><BR>
 MGI 2.9 presents an entirely new look and feel for our Web pages. A new search tool enables users to quickly find any gene symbol or name, accession ID, reference abstract, phenotype, gene expression data, Gene Ontology (GO) term, Anatomical Dictionary structure, Festing strain characteristic, or Mouse Locus Catalog (MLC) text contained in our database. We redesigned our Gene Detail page to encompass more information. MGI marker records now link to Ensembl mouse gene model; we also obtain chromosome map locations for MGI genes associated with Ensembl gene models. MGI marker records also link to computationally-derived transcript assemblies from the Database of Transcribed Sequence (DoTS) as well as from the Mouse Gene Index developed at The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR).</P>
 
<P><EM><B>March 2002</B></EM><BR>
 MGI 2.8 presents phenotype classification terms for locating alleles that produce a particular phenotype. The GO Browser is enhanced: users can query Gene Ontology terms by structure in MGI and see a hierarchical return of gene records annotated to that structure as well as its substructures. The release also includs an electronic version of Lee Silver's <I>Mouse Genetics</I>.

<P><EM><B>May 2001</B></EM><BR>
 MGI 2.7 consists largely of enhancements to the Alleles Query Form and to the Phenotypic
Alleles Query Results Summary and Detail pages. On the form, there is a new search field for promoter notes. The summary and detail pages now display ES cell line associations, links to gene expression in genotypes with a given allele, and additional references.

<P><EM><B>February 2001</B></EM><BR>
 MGI 2.6 includes MGD links to Locus Link, RefSeq, and Interpro databases; a Your Input Welcome 
 button for sending marker or allele corrections to User Support; new rules and guidelines for genes, 
 alleles, and mutation nomenclature; and links from the MGI Help documentation to the glossary.

<P><EM><B>October 2000</B></EM><BR>
 MGI 2.5 includes the GO and Mouse Anatomy Dictionary vocabulary browsers, whole genome maps of 
 conserved regions for human and rat plotted against mouse chromosomes, and an expanded glossary 
 linked to MGI Help documentation.<!-- and a form and rules for submitting new allele and mutant data, 
 which was part of a "special" MGI Home release on 11/8/00, just before the IMGC meeting -->

<P><EM><B>May 2000</B></EM><BR>
 MGI 2.4 features the first use of Gene Ontology (GO) vocabularies to annotate genes. Allele 
 information is now stored independently of phenotypic descriptions and searchable by an Alleles query  form.  Marker symbol and names fields combined into a single field on various MGI query forms.

<P><EM><B>April 2000</EM></B><BR>
