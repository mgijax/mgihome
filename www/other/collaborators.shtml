<B><A HREF="http://www.geneontology.org">Gene Ontology Consortium</A></B> (GO)<P>
<SMALL>
We are part of the Gene Ontology Consortium that also currently includes <A HREF="http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu/">Flybase</A> and <A HREF="http://genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces/">SGD</A> (Saccharomyces Genome Database).  We are developing extensive, structured vocabularies for molecular function, biological process, cellular component and annotating genes/gene products within each of our species' databases using these vocabularies. These ontologies and annotations will be accessible from our species' database web sites and from a jointly developed web site. <BR>

<B><A HREF="http://genome.wustl.edu/est/mouse_esthmpg.html">
WashU</A></B> (Washington University)<P>
<SMALL>
We work with the I.M.A.G.E. consortium to pre-assign MGI accession numbers to I.M.A.G.E. clones, which are, in turn, sequenced by Washington University.  The I.M.A.G.E. and MGI accession identifiers travel in pairs and are submitted to <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/index.html">dbEST</A> (database of Expressed Sequence Tags) directly with the sequencing data.  Thus the connection between an EST, the clone it was derived from, and the MGI accession identifier is generated.<BR>

<B><A HREF="../nomen/">International Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice</A>,  <A HREF="http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/">  HUGO Human Gene Nomenclature Committee</A>, </B>and <B><A HREF="http://ratmap.gen.gu.se/ratmap/WWWNomen/RGNC.html">Rat Gene Nomenclature Committee</A></B>. <P>
<SMALL>
We work closely with the human and rat international nomenclature groups to assign gene symbols wherever feasible, to evaluate gene family nomenclature, and to maintain consistent use of nomenclature for human, mouse and rat species.<BR>

<P><HR><BR>
<B><A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink/">LocusLink at NCBI</A></B>. (National Center for Biotechnology Information) <P>
<SMALL>
Working with LocusLink, we provide official nomenclature for mouse genes, our curated links between genes and sequence identifiers in GenBank, chromosomal, cytogenetic and centimorgan map positions, and MGI accession numbers.  LocusLink uses these curated data to develop reference sequences for mouse and notify us of new GenBank mouse sequences submitted.<BR>

<P><HR><BR>
<B><A HREF="http://genex.hgu.mrc.ac.uk/">Mouse Atlas and Anatomy Database</A></B> <P>
<SMALL>
We collaborate with the Mouse Atlas and Anatomy Database projects to develop and extend a structured vocabulary describing the anatomy of the mouse for each Theiler stage of embryonic development. These vocabularies are used throughtout our database, wherever anatomical data are found (e.g., expression data, clone library information, phenotypic descriptions).

<P><HR><BR>
<B><A HREF="http://www.informatics.jax.org/ccr">Mouse Chromosome Committees</A></B><P>
<SMALL>
We host the Chromosome Committee Reports on our web site and have developed tools for the Committee Chairs to submit and update reports and files.  The Committees provide MGD with centimorgan positions from their evaluations of all available mapping data for their chromosome.  In addition, their reports present information on mapping methods, mutations,  human gene homologs, a narrative of new developments, and other files and graphics of interest.

<B><A HREF="http://www.expasy.ch/sprot/">SWISS-PROT</A></B>  (The SWISS-PROT Protein Sequence Data Bank)<P>
<SMALL>Our curation staff works closely with SWISS-PROT staff to co-curate links between genes and proteins.  We provide nomenclature data and primary gene-to-GenBank accession id information; we receive gene-to-protein links and expanded gene-to-sequence associations.
