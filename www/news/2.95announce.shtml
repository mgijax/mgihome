<p>MGI is pleased to announce its 2.95 release.<br>
<ul>
<li>We want to hear from you! Please take the time to respond to our 
<a href="../other/mgi_survey.shtml">survey</a> and help us improve MGI resources. </li> <br><br> 

<li>A new feature on the 
<a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker.cgi">Genes and Markers Query Form</a> provides an option to search by nomenclature. The summary results present a list of matches on your query term ordered by matches on the current symbol, current name, allele symbol, allele name, withdrawn symbol, withdrawn name, synonym, human ortholog symbol, human ortholog name, all other orthologs, and symbols/not names. Each item of information is linked to a detail page. If the item you are looking for is not present on the list, you can see at a glance how to narrow your query by altering the search string. </li><br><br>

<li>Our new <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/MP_form.shtml">Mammalian Phenotype Browser</a> lets you browse or search for synonyms or structures associated with phenotype categories. You can use the vocabulary to annotate genes and the descriptive terms as search criteria for finding genes.</li><br><br>


<li>Our query form help documents are now in the form of frequently asked questions (FAQs). We hope you will find them easier to use. To access help on a query form, click on the question mark at the top.  Click 
<a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/expression_help.shtml">Using the Gene Expression Data Query Form</a> to see one of the new help documents. </li> <br><br>


<li>The remainder of the 2.95 release consists of improvements to our web pages and several bug fixes.<br><br>

</ul>
  


<!--<li>A new toolbar enables you to access query forms, get help, use MouseBLAST, find out more about MGI, discover what's new, and explore our resources.
 <br><br>         
  <li>A new text search tool helps you to locate information in the MGI database quickly. You can search for gene symbols or names, accession IDs, reference abstracts, phenotypes, gene expression data, Gene Ontology (GO) terms, Mouse Anatomical Dictionary structures, Festing's Strain Characteristics, or Mouse Locus Catalog (MLC) text. See <A href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/searchtool_help.shtml">Using the Search Tool</a>.
 <br><br>         
<li>Our redesigned Gene Detail page makes information much more accessible and now includes links to several new reports.                         
  <br><br>                          

<li>MGI marker records are now linked to <A HREF="http://www.ensembl.org/">Ensembl</a> mouse gene models that share a common external sequence accession ID with those models. We also obtain chromosome map locations for MGI genes associated with Ensembl gene models. Ensembl is a joint project between the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">European Bioinformatics Institute/European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL-EBI)</a> and the <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</a> <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/">Sanger Institute</a>. 
<br><br>

<li>
MGI marker records are also linked to computationally derived transcript assemblies from <a href="http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/">CBIL/DoTS</a>, the Database of Transcribed Sequences, developed at the Computational Biology and Informatics Laboratory</a>  at the University of Pennsylvania. (See <a href="http://www.allgenes.org">AllGenes</a> for more information). Associations between MGI markers and assemblies are based on shared GenBank sequence accession identifiers.  Only associations between MGI genes and DTs supported by non-conflicting evidence are accessible for these resources. The links are updated after every major change in MGI databases. 

<br><br>

<li>MGI marker records are linked as well to computationally derived transcript assemblies from the <A HREF="http://www.tigr.org/tdb/tgi/mgi/">TIGR Mouse Gene Index</a> developed at <a href="http://www.tigr.org/">The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR)</a>. Associations between MGI markers and assemblies are based on shared GenBank sequence accession identifiers. Only associations between MGI genes and TCs supported by non-conflicting evidence are accessible for these resources. The links are updated after each build of TIGR's Mouse Gene Index and after every major change in MGI databases.-->
