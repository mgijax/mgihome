<p>The Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) Database is collecting information to support the NIH Knockout Mice Repatriation Project. The goal of this project is to make existing mouse strains carrying targeted knockouts (nulls and conditionals) more accessible to the scientific community by facilitating the placement of these stocks into public repositories.
</p>
<p>On the <a href="http://www.informatics.jax.org">MGI home page</a> (http://www.informatics.jax.org), you will find links to two forms to:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="../submissions/nih_nomination.shtml">Nominate Knockouts for Placement in Public Repositories</a> &#151; where you can indicate the genes (or specific knockout alleles) that are high priority for your research interests.</li>
  <li><a href="../submissions/nih_repatriation.shtml">Submit Data on Knockouts for Possible Repatriation</a> &#151; where you can provide information on knockouts that you have developed or maintain and would like to contribute to this repatriation effort.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also provided with these web forms are links to lists of knockout mice that have been published but are not yet in repositories, as well as links to those knockouts that are available through repositories. These lists are dynamically generated from MGI and IMSR, thus allowing newly knocked-out alleles to continue to enter the pool of nominations. Prioritization of mice for repatriation will be ongoing for the next few years as the NIH Knockout Mouse Project develops.
</p>
<p>See  <a href="http://www.nih.gov/science/models/mouse/knockout/index.html">NIH Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP)</a> for more information.
