<h2>MGD 3.1 Update</h2>

<hr>

<h3>MGD 3.1 Enhancements now available</h3>
<ul> 
<li><strong>New data set</strong><p>
 <a href="/rcset.html"> Composite Recombinant Congenic Strain Distribution Patterns
  data</a> can be retrieved using a new query form accessed in the 
  "Maps and Mapping Data" section of MGD.
<p>
Information on four recombinant congenic strain sets is currently available.
  Data include the progenitor strains for each RCS set 
  and tables showing the allelic distribution 
  for each genetic marker that has been typed in each of the 
  recombinant congenic strains. Each row represents 
 the typing for a genetic marker and each column represents alleles
 carried by a specific recombinant congenic strain of the RCS set. 
Format of the report is very similar to that of the Composite Recombinant Inbred Strains distribution patterns. 
 
<p>
<li> <strong>Chromosome Committee Reports</strong><p>
  The HTML versions of the <a href="/ccr/95/">1995 Chromosome Committee Reports</a>
  are now complete.
<p>
<li> <strong>1996 Chromosome Committee Chairs</strong><p>
  The names and addresses for the<a href="/bin/ccr/96/chairs"> 1996 Chromosome Committee chairs</a>
  are now available.
<p>
<li> <strong>Link to RATMAP via homologies</strong><p>
  MGD now links to RATMAP, <a href="http://ratmap.gen.gu.se">http://ratmap.gen.gu.se</a>, 
  a "database covering genes physically mapped to
  chromosomes in the laboratory rat," maintained by the Department of
  Genetics, Goteborgs Universitet, Sweden.
<p>
<li> <strong>Back-end changes</strong><p>
  The software group has implemented a number of changes to the
  database structure and software to enhance the efficiency of
  the system. 
</ul>
