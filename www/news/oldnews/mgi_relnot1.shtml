Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) 1.0 Release Notes
<BR>
<EM>
<SMALL>
February 13, 1998
</SMALL>
</EM>
</CENTER>
</H2>
<HR>
The MGI Web site provides integrated access to various information resources on the genetics and biology of the laboratory mouse, including the Mouse Genome Database (MGD), the Gene Expression Database (GXD) and the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> of the Mouse Genome (<EM>Encyclopedia</EM>).
<p>
<H3>New Features</H3> 

<H4>Reorganization of the Web Interface</H4>
A new <A HREF="/index.html">MGI home page</A> provides links to high-level descriptive documentation, searches and reports, help and other information. The background color for all MGI web pages has been set to white.  (This does not affect any color specification an individual user sets for a browser on his or her own machine.) 
<p>
<EM>Searches, Data and Reports
</EM>
<BR>
The <EM>Searches, Data and Reports</EM> section of the MGI home page 
includes a listing of biological topics (accessible either from the 
home page or using the text links beneath the banner appearing on all 
other MGI pages).  Each topic is linked to a menu which presents the 
available searching options for information in that biological area.  
For example, the <EM><A HREF="/mrktools.html">Genetic and Phenotypic 
Data</A></EM> menu presents a list of the query forms (each with a 
brief description) that enable you to search for information on markers 
and phenotypes; a list of relevant database reports available; and a list 
of related resources.  The  <em>Searches, Data and Reports</em> listing 
also includes links to the <EM>Query Menu</EM> (described below), 
<EM>Chromosome Committee Reports</EM> menu, and <EM>Accession ID</EM> 
searching options.
<P>
<EM>MGI Banner</EM>
<BR>
The MGI Banner has been streamlined.  The hypertext links under 
the banner reflect the items appearing on the MGI home page. The 
banner image, itself,  no longer contains hypertext links.
<P>
<EM>
Query Menu
</EM>
<BR>
As described above, the MGI interface provides menus related to 
biological topics which show you all the options for retrieving 
information 
in that area. For those users who prefer to go directly to a 
query form and bypass the menus, a new <EM>
<A HREF="/query_menu.html"TARGET="menu_window" onClick="QueryMenu()">
Query Menu</A></EM> window provides direct access to the query forms. 
(A link to the <EM>Query Menu</EM> is found in the Searches, Data and 
Reports section of the home page and under the MGI banner on other 
MGI pages.) When you open the <EM>Query Menu</EM>, a small window 
containing the complete list of query forms is displayed on your desktop 
separate from the browser window. When you click on a form name, the 
form opens in the browser window from which you selected the <EM>Query 
Menu</EM>.  If you click on another form name in the <EM>Query 
Menu</EM>, the newly selected form will then be displayed on this page. 
(Note: This feature assumes that your system supports Java script. 
It will still work if your system does not support Java script but 
it will look a bit different.)
<P>
<H4><A HREF="/estclone.html">cDNA and EST Expression Query Form</A></H4>

This query form enables you to search for cDNA and EST expression 
information related to specified genes and origin (tissue, age, 
cell line).  The query results are given in a tabular list showing for 
each retrieved segment: <EM>Probe/Segment AccID, Name, Age, Tissue, 
Cell Line</EM> and <EM>Gene</EM>.  The probe/segment accession ID is 
linked to the probe/segment detail record and the gene symbol is linked 
to the marker detail record.  Implied associations between markers and 
segments are noted as Putative.

<H4><A HREF="/oxford.html">Oxford Grid Query Form</A></H4>
The <EM>Oxford Grid</EM> query option is now on a form separate from the 
Mammalian Homology query form. A new feature of the <EM>Oxford Grid</EM> 
display is the option to click on a mouse chromosome number on the 
outside edge of the grid to generate a graphical comparative map of 
the selected mouse chromosome showing all homologies from the comparison 
species. 

In addition, when you click on a colored cell in a grid to display and 
retrieve the detailed homology results, you will see a link to a 
<B>Comparative map</B>. Selecting this link will retrieve a graphic 
display of a region of the mouse chromosome within 2 cM of the selected 
marker and any homologies in this region from the comparison species. 
Access to comparative maps only applies to queries for which mouse is 
one of the selected species.

<H3>Enhancements
</H3>
<H4>Formatting for Query Forms</H4>
The form fields have been reformatted to accommodate differences between 
Netscape and Internet Explorer.  Some selection list fields now have a 
default value of ANY. This is to accommodate Internet Explorer which 
always treats the first value in a selection list as the default value.

<H4>Name or Unofficial Symbol Field on Some Forms</H4>
Formerly, the <B>Name</B> field for the name of a marker, this field is 
now the <B>Name or Unofficial Symbol</B> field on the following query 
forms: <EM>Genes, Markers and Phenotypes, Molecular Probes and Segments, 
GXD Index</EM>, and <EM>cDNA and EST Expression</EM>.  This field 
enables you to search using the current name, or an unofficial symbol 
(or name), for a marker.  An unofficial symbol (or name) is one that has been used 
to refer to a marker and may appear in the literature but has never 
been approved by the International Committee on Standard Nomenclature 
for Mice.

<H4>Enhancements to the <A HREF="/homology.html">Mammalian Homology Query Form</A></H4>
You can now choose to limit the maximum number of items to return 
in an homology query. This number refers to the number of homology 
`classes' returned. (An homology  class is the set of homologies to 
a marker in the primary species selected for the query.) By default
, homologies for only the species selected for the query are shown.
<P>
The <B>Symbol(s)</B> field now enables you to search on one or more 
current marker symbols in the primary species. The <B>Chromosome(s)</B> 
field now enables you to search on one or more chromosomes in either 
the primary or comparison species selected for the query.
<P>
Query results have been reorganized to have a more compact, tabular 
format with a link to References appearing at the bottom of each 
displayed homology class. In addition, a link to a <B>Comparative 
map</B> is shown if the query specifies mouse as one of the species to 
compare. The link to comparative maps will specify a comparison 
species determined by the species included in the query results.  
Each comparative map shows the region of a mouse chromosome within 2 cM 
of the selected mouse marker and shows any homologies for the selected 
species .

<H4>References Query Results Display Includes "Review Status"</H4>
More and more data are derived from sources other than published journal 
articles.  The <EM>Review Status</EM> field on the Reference detail 
record may be either <B>Peer Reviewed, MGI Editorial Staff Reviewed</B> 
or <B>Unreviewed</B>. "Peer Reviewed" indicates the reference was 
published in a scientific journal; "MGI Editorial Staff Reviewed" 
indicates data electronically submitted that have been reviewed by 
MGI staff; "Unreviewed" indicates data from some other source such 
as a personal communication, electronic data transfer from another 
on-line source, an article from a non peer reviewed publication, or 
unreviewed direct submission.  

<H4>Phenotype Detail Results Reformatted</H4>
The Mouse Locus Catalog (MLC) display format for phenotype records is 
more compact and readable. In addition, the phenotype results contains 
links under <B>Additional Information</B> to homology and mapping 
information related to the gene.

<H4>Linkage Map Form Handling of Syntenic Markers Improved</H4>
If you choose to build a map of a whole chromosome, you can now choose 
to exclude the syntenic markers from the map display or file. 

<H4><EM>Encyclopedia</EM> Modifications</H4>
The <EM><A HREF="/encyclo.html">Encyclopedia</A></EM> page is now 
accessed under the <EM>Maps and Mapping Data</EM> menu. From this 
page, you can download the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> application to your 
Macintosh computer. You will also find instructions for configuring 
Netscape to recognize the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> as a helper 
application. As of this release, only the Macintosh version of 
the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> is supported.  All data for building 
map displays in <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> format is now retrieved from 
the database using MGD cM position values.  

<H4>User Documentation</H4>
User Documentation for MGD, GXD and the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> has been 
updated and reorganized to
reflect the changes and features of the MGI 1.0 release. 

<H4>Data Cleanup in Several Data Sets</H4>
Mouse strain names have been made consistent throughout MGD and GXD.  
Cell Line and Tissue names have been made consistent for molecular 
probes and segments records.
