MGD Release 3.2 New features and enhancements include<BR>

<UL>
<LI>1997 Chromosome Committee Reports on-line
<LI>Two new MGD query forms
<LI>Various cosmetic changes to MGD query forms
<LI>Updates and new additions to MGD data sets
<LI>Updates and reformatting of user documentation
</UL>

<P>
<A HREF="/bin/ccr/current/index" ><B>1997 Chromosome Committee Reports</B></A>
<BR>
In MGD 3.2, the Chromosome Committee reports are presented in
a standardized, hypertext format. For most chromosomes, the report
includes:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Author list
<LI>Narrative
<LI>Table 1.  Locus list (alphabetical by symbol)
<LI>Table 2.  Locus list (ordered by cM position)
<LI>Acknowledgments
<LI>PostScript map
</UL>
<P>
The components vary somewhat depending on the information received
from the committees.  In some cases, a committee report may have a single table,
while other reports may include multiple tables and images. The PostScript
maps are downloaded to your machine.  You can either send the
file to a printer or display the file using a PostScript viewer.
<P>
Chromosome Committees  now submit their reports via a Web submission
interface implemented in the latter half of 1996.  The new interface
greatly facilitates report submission, provides options for editing
already submitted files, and ensures a standardized format for
the reports.<BR>

<P>
<B>Web Maps</B>
<BR>
Prior to MGD 3.2, the <A HREF="/encyclo.html" ><I>Encyclopedia</I> </A>was
the only map viewing tool available from MGI.  Because the <I>Encyclopedia</I>
is supported only on Macintosh and UNIX, there has long been a
need for a  platform-independent graphical map display. 
A new &quot;Web Map&quot; option on the <A HREF="/map.html" >Linkage Maps query form </A>enables
you to retrieve a linkage map from MGD and display it on a Web
page.  The Web Map formatting produces a GIF (Graphical Image Format)
image. The marker symbols appearing on the map are hyper-linked
to detailed marker records. (NOTE: Although hyper-links within an image
are supported in Netscape 3.X, some browsers do not support this
feature.)
<P>
The default format option on the Linkage Maps form is now <B>Web
Map</B>.  The other format options are <B>Encyclopedia</B> and
<B>PostScript</B>.  The same MGD searching options apply to all
formats.<br>


<P>
<A HREF="/cmap.html" ><B>Cytogenetic Maps Query Form</B></A>
<BR>
You can now retrieve cytogenetic maps from MGD in Web Map format
providing a display of a chromosome divided into cytogenetic bands
with markers positioned accordingly. Marker symbols on the map
are linked to MGD marker records.  The Cytogenetic Maps query
form enables you to select a single chromosome and query MGD for
information to build the map which reflects the most current data
content in MGD.  You can print this map but keep in mind that
the image may be much wider than an 8x11 page.  To print the map on 
a single page, use the printing and page format options available on
your system to set set page orientation to "landscape" or "scale" the
image to reduce the image size for printing.
 On the Macintosh, these options are found within
the <B>File/Page Setup...</B> menu.
<P>
Cytogenetic placement of genes is obtained from in situ and 
deletion mapping experiment records in MGD and, for chromosomal 
aberrations, from karyotypic analysis. 

<BR>
<P>
<B>DNA Mapping Panels</B>
<BR>
<I>The following DNA mapping panels have been <B>updated:</B></I>
<PRE>
<FONT SIZE=3>Copeland-Jenkins: (C57BL/6J x M. spretus)F1 x C57BL/6J 
EUCIB (BSB): (C57BL/6J x SPR or SEG/Pas)F1 x C57BL/6J 
EUCIB (BSS): (C57BL/6J x SPR or SEG/Pas)F1 x SPR or SEG/Pas 
JAX (BSB): (C57BL/6J x M. spretus)F1 x C57BL/6J 
JAX (BSS): (C57BL/6JEi x SPRET/Ei)F1 x SPRET/Ei 
MIT (C57BL/6J-ob/ob x CAST)F1 x (C57BL/6J-ob/ob x CAST)F1
</FONT>
</PRE>
<P>
<I>The following DNA mapping panels have been <B>added</B>:</I>
<PRE>
<FONT SIZE=3>Kozak FvC58: (NFS/N x M. spretus) F1 x C58/J 
Kozak FvSpr: (NFS/N x M. spretus)F1 x M. spretus 
Kozak Skive: (NFS/N or C58/J x M. m. musculus)F1 x M. m. musculus
Reeves (Chr 16): Sex-averaged intersubspecific mapping panel 
</FONT>
</PRE>

<P>
The <A HREF="/crossdata.html" >DNA Mapping Panel Data Sets query form </A>accessed
from the <A HREF="/maptools.html" >Maps and Mapping Data</A> menu
provides options for retrieving these data sets. You can either
view the data in hypertext format on a Web page, or download the
files in tab-delimited text or Map Manager format.<BR>

<P>
<A HREF="/rflp.html" ><B>RFLP/PCR Polymorphisms Query Form</B></A>
<BR>
You can now search for molecular polymorphisms related to a gene,
chromosome or mouse strain. You can also retrieve allelic typings
for a specified mouse strain. This information is drawn from PCR
primer and probe/clone records in MGD. The form provides some
searching tips and a link to a listing of strains. This listing
takes the guess work out of specifying correct strain designations
in your query.
<P>
The RFLP/PCR Polymorphism query is MGD's first pass at making
polymorphism information more readily accessible than in previous
releases.  In future releases, we will provide options to compare
strains as well.<BR>

<P>
<A HREF="/bin/strains/search" ><B>List of Inbred Strains of Mouse and Rat (M. Festing)</B></A>
<BR>
Information on over 200 rat strains is now available from Michael Festings's List of Inbred Strains of Mouse and Rat. Information on the mouse strains has also been updated. An introduction and list of references is available for
 both mouse and rat.  You can search
for information on inbred strains by entering a search string
in the search field.  The <B>Glimpse</B> full-text search engine
executes the search of both Mouse and Rat listings for records
containing the text you entered.  The query results are separated
under Mouse and Rat headings. A link to <A HREF="textsearch.html" >text-searching help </A>is
provided.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Oxford Grid Display</B>
<BR>
An Oxford Grid graphically displays a genome-wide overwiew of 
genetic homology between two species.  The colors of the Grid 
have been modified to reflect the extent of homology in each
conserved genomic segment known.  The option to retrieve an 
Oxford Grid is found on the <A HREF="/homology.html">Mammalian Homology query form</A>.<P> 

On the Oxford Grid display, each cell of the grid represents 
a comparison of two chromosomes, one from each of the selected 
species. The number of homologies for each comparison appears 
inside each colored cell and the color indicates a range in 
the number: Gray (1), Blue (2-10), Green (11-25), 
Orange (26-50), Yellow (50+). Each colored cell is linked to 
homology records for the two chromosomes represented 
by that cell allowing you to click on a cell and retrieve 
the detailed homology records.<BR>
<P>
<B>Changes to Existing Query Forms</B>
<BR>
You will notice a smaller <B>banner</B> at the top of each query
form.  There are some modifications and new additions to the <B>text
hyperlinks</B> beneath the banner.  The <B>title</B> of each query
form is now linked directly to the user document related to that
form. <B>Links</B> to the<B> </B><I>Alternative Query Interface</I>
and <I>MGI Data</I> <I>and Statistical Reports</I> have been <B>removed</B>
from the header area of each query form. The option to <B>Connect
terms</B> with AND or OR has been removed from all query forms.
<P>
On the References, Probes and Clones, and PCR Primer query forms,
the search fields have been re-arranged.  The &quot;Sequence AccNum&quot;
field appearing on several forms has been renamed<B> DNA Seq AccNum</B>
to reflect the name used by the sequence databases.<P>
<P>
<B>Short Forms</B>
<BR>
Previously grouped under the <B>Alternative Query Interface</B>,
<A HREF="/noforms.html" >Short Forms</A> are now accessed from
the  MGD Home Page under the <B>Searches</B> heading.  A short
form provides a single search field.  Short forms provide a quick
alternative to loading full query forms when you want to execute
a simple search of an MGD data set.  For short forms that use
text-entry search fields, a link to information on using wildcards
has been provided.<BR>

<P>
<B>Data and Statistical Reports</B>
<BR>
A link to these reports is found on the MGD Home Page and there is an
 "MGD Reports" link located beneath the banner near the top of 
every MGD query form.

<P>
MGD Data and Statistical reports are generated nightly and provide
the following listings:
<UL>
<LI>Mouse genetic marker lists using various sort options and options for
marker types 
<LI>Mouse and Human homologies sorted various ways
<LI>Rat and Mouse homologies sorted various ways
<LI>General statistics on the data content of MGD
<LI>Marker symbols and keys formatted in tab-delimited text
</UL>

<P>
Some of these reports are rather large and may exhaust the browser
memory available on some machines.  To work around this problem,
you may want to download reports in text format.  These reports
are available as text files from our <A HREF="ftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/reports" >ftp server</A>.
<P>
<B>New Link to ENZYME</B><BR>
If the detailed marker record for an enzyme includes an EC (Enzyme Commission) 
number, that number is now linked to the <A HREF="http://www.expasy.hcuge.ch/sprot/enzyme.html">ENZYME</A> database. <P>
<BR>
