<h2>Encyclopedia of the Mouse Genome 3.0 </h2>
<h2>Release Announcement </h2>

<h3>November 21, 1994</h3>
<hr>
The Encyclopedia of the Mouse Genome (<i>Encyclopedia</i>) provides a 
clean, sharp graphic display of mouse chromosome maps with a flexible, 
easy-to-use interface.
<p>
The <i>Encyclopedia</i> consists of software and data files that are 
downloaded from our ftp server onto your computer. The 
<i>Encyclopedia</i>  also provides links to 'live' data in MGD.
<p>
In this release, the <i>Encyclopedia</i> provides access to

- 1994 Chromosome Committee Reports  
- October1994 MIT Whitehead Institute genetic maps
- MGD mouse locus mapping and homology information
<p>
Note:

You must download the new data files.  You cannot use previous 
versions of <i>Encyclopedia</i>  data files with this release.
<p>
The following versions of the <i>Encyclopedia</i>  are now 
available from The Jackson Laboratory ftp server:<p>

<strong><i>Alpha Test</i>  Version 1.0a13 for MacOS</strong><br>
<strong><i>Alpha Test</i>  Version 3.0a2 for UNIX</strong>
<p>
"Alpha Test" means that the <i>Encyclopedia</i> software is still 
under  development and is not a complete and finished software product.  
This Alpha Test version software is available to you for exploration 
and testing.  However, you may encounter software bugs.  The user 
documentation is likewise work-in-progress.
<p>
Your comments, questions, problem reports, and suggestions are 
extremely valuable to the ongoing development of the 
<i>Encyclopedia</i>.  Please contact User Support with your feedback.

<h3>New Features</h3>

<strong><i>Encyclopedia</i> interacts with the Mouse Genome Database(MGD)</strong>
<p>
Note: NCSA Mosaic 2.0 must reside on your system to support this 
interaction. (If you do not have Mosaic, the <i>Encyclopedia</i> 
will run normally but without interaction with MGD.)  
<p>
When you  start the <i>Encyclopedia</i>, it will automatically start 
a Mosaic session. When you click on a locus displayed on a chromosome map, 
the <i>Encyclopedia</i> will search MGD for information on that locus 
and the locus record will be displayed in the Mosaic window.
<p>
You can also generate an <i>Encyclopedia</i> linkmap using information 
from  MGD database tables. This option is available on the MGD home page. 
You can display all the loci on a chromosome or a region of a chromosome 
defined by a selected subset of loci.  You can also select one from 
a list of 40 species to generate a comparative map for the mouse 
and another mammalian species.  
<p>
For now, these integration features are only available with 
NCSA Mosaic browsers.  
<p>
<strong>Common data file format for UNIX and Macintosh versions</strong>
<p>
Both UNIX and Macintosh versions  of the software use the same data 
file format now, so there is a single set of data  files presented 
in this release.  The new format is much smaller and can be loaded 
more quickly than the old format files.
<p>
<strong>User documentation available on the World Wide Web(WWW)</strong>
<p>
Now you can access the <i>Encyclopedia</i> user documentation from the WWW. 
You can open the documentation using the Help button on the menu bar 
of the <i>Encyclopedia</I>.
<p>
<strong>Features specific to the Macintosh version</strong>
<ul>
<li> In the Macintosh version of the <i>Encyclopedia</I> , you can now specify 
   characteristics of the map display such as font and background color.

<li>You can save a map in PICT file format.
</ul><p>
Refer to the README file accompanying the Macintosh version
software for details.
<p>
<strong>Features specific to the UNIX version</strong>
<p>
In the UNIX version of the <i>Encyclopedia</I> , you can 
<br>
<UL>
<li> Change "attributes", such as color and font, for a class of loci. 
<li> Copy and paste from Notes and References panes to text files.
<li> Print a map file (not just generate a PostScript file)
</UL><br>
Refer to the README file accompanying the UNIX version
software for details.


<h3>Installation </h3>

The <i>Encyclopedia</I> software and data files may be downloaded 
from our Informatics ftp server.  You can install using our WWW 
interface or by starting an ftp session.  These two approaches 
are briefly described below.
<p>

<strong>Using the WWW interface</strong>
<p>
You can download the executable and data files using an option 
available the Jackson Laboratory Bioinformatics WWW server.  The URL is
<p>
<strong><!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"--></strong>
<p>
From the Home Page, you  select  the following option:
<p>
<strong>Download the current version of the <i>Encyclopedia</I> of 
the Mouse Genome</strong>
<p>
Additional configuration steps required to support the integration with 
MGD and instructions are provided.
<p>

<strong>Using ftp</strong>
<p>
You can connect to the Jackson Laboratory anonymous ftp server using the
address:
<br>
<strong>ftp.informatics.jax.org</strong>
<br>
The following directories contain the files you need: 
<br>
For the data files for all platforms,
<br>
	<strong>/pub/informatics/encyclo/data/3.0 </strong>
<br>
For the Macintosh executable, release notes and installation 
instructions,
<br>
	<strong>/pub/informatics/encyclo/mac </strong>
<br>
For UNIX executables for all supported UNIX platforms,  
release notes and installation instructions,
<br>
	<strong>/pub/informatics/encyclo/unix/3.0</strong>
