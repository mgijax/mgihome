<h2>Mouse Genome Database (MGD) 3.1 Release Announcement</h2>
<p>
<h2><em>February 13, 1996</em></h2>
<hr>
<STRONG>MGD 3.1 is now available from the World Wide Web</STRONG>
(<a href="http://www.informatics.jax.org">http://www.informatics.jax.org</A>).<p>

See <A HREF="/doc/oldnews/3.1relnotes.html">MGD 3.1 Release Notes</A> for details. <p>

<h3>New Features</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<LI>Access to the <a href="/gxd.html">Gene Expression Database (GXD) Index</A>
<p>
Use the GXD icon on the MGI or MGD Home Page. GXD documentation
and a GXD Index query form are now available.
<P>
<LI>WWW access to <a href="/ccr/95">1995 Chromosome Committee Reports</A>
<P>
The 1995 Chromosome Committee Reports are now
available on our WWW site.  Select "Chromosome Committee
Reports" from the MGD Home Page. <em>Note: Some reports are
not yet complete.  As updates are received, they will be made available.</em>
<P>
<LI>Retrieve homology information in  "Oxford grid" format
<P>
An Oxford Grid provides an overview of homologies
between the genomes of two selected species.  Each colored box
in the grid indicates known homologies and you can click on the
box to retrieve the records. This option is available on the <a href=
"/homology.html">Homology query form</A>.
<P>
<LI>New MGD Data and Statistical Reports available<p>
MGD Data and Statistical Reports now include a listing of homologies between mouse and rat and a listing of mutant markers that
have been withdrawn and identified as alleles of other markers. These lists may
be viewed sorted in various ways.

<P>
See <a href="/reports.html">MGI Data and Statistical Reports</A> on the MGD Home Page.
<P>
<LI>MGD Schema Query Form <p>
MGD is built using SYBASE relational database management system. Now, you
can get information about the MGD database schema. This is especially useful
to those interested in the public SQL interface to MGD. See <A HREF="/mgd_schema.html">MGD Schema Query Form</A> on the 
MGD Home Page.<p>
</UL>

<H3>Enhancements</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Modified MGI banner has new icons and other links.
<P>
<LI>On MGD query forms, the J number field can now accept multiple values separated by a comma.
<P>
<LI>Linkage Map tool changes<p>
The Linkage Map form provides an option to build a map using the markers
entered in the <em>Additional Markers</em> field exclusively. To activate
this option, select <strong>Use ONLY markers entered on this form</em> from
the Map Source list.<p>
In addition, a revised map generation algorithm has improved performance
of the Linkage Map tool.

<p>
<LI>On the Genetic Markers... query form, you can now search for mutant alleles
by using the phrase <em>allele of</em> in the <em>Name</em> field.<br>
<em>Note: When searching for mutant alleles, you must use the <em>Name</em> 
alone.</em> 
<P>
<LI>The detailed query results for genetic marker queries now contain a link
to <em>Expression Data</em> retrieved from the GXD Index. This link appears
under <em>Additional Information</em> if GXD information is available for
a marker.  
<P>
<LI>On the References query form, fields for <em>Chromosome</em>, <em>Volume</em> and <em>Pages</em> have been added. Now, you can search for all the
references related to a chromosome. 
<P>
<LI>On the Homology form, the species lists now start with the two most
frequently used species: mouse and human. Also, you now have the option
view query results from two selected species. Previously, the homology
search always retrieved all the homologies for a given gene including
the selected species and any other species sharing the homology. Now,
seeing the homologies for all species is optional.
</UL>
<p>
NOTE: <p>
<blockquote>Before using MGD 3.1, be sure to clear the Web browser cache
on your computer to get rid of old MGD forms.</blockquote>
