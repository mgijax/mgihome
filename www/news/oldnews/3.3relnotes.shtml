MGD 3.3 Release Notes</H2>

<b><em>June 12, 1997</b></em><p>

There have been important changes to the structure of the database to enable
MGD to manage rapidly expanding data content and lay the foundations for more
efficient access to data. For example, the way Accession IDs are assigned to
records and stored in the database has changed to facilitate the creation of
links between MGD and other database as well as to facilitate searching for MGD
records by Accession ID. Another important structural change has been to merge
the PCR Primer records with Probes and Clones records and create a new data
set, "Molecular Probes and Segments." This expanded data set includes records
for 170,000 ESTs and their source clones. Mouse physical mapping records have
been downloaded from MIT and are accessible using the Mapping Data query form.
These and other enhancements to the structure and interface of MGD are
discussed in the sections that follow.<p>

<H3>Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) Data</H3>
<b></b>170,000 ESTs and their clones have been entered in MGD. These
data are generated through the collaborative efforts of the Washington
University (WashU) EST project, the Integrated Molecular Analysis of Genomes and their
Expression (I.M.A.G.E) consortium, and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).<p>

ESTs are searchable using the <A HREF="/probe.html">Molecular Probes and Segments</A> query form. "EST"
has been added to the selection list for the "DNA type" field. To search for
ESTs, you could, for example, select EST for the sequence type, specify a
marker in the Marker Symbol field and retrieve any EST records associated with
that marker. The record for each EST includes a link to the MGD record for the
clone from which it is derived as well as links to the sequence databases
(Genbank, EMBL, GSDB, DDBJ) and links to WashU and dbEST. The marker symbol
for the gene (if any) with which the EST has been putatively associated.<p>
Each EST source clone record includes links to the MGD records for the ESTs
related to it, and links to clone records in LLNL and ATCC.
 <p>
<H3>MIT Mouse Physical Mapping Data</H3>
An ongoing project at MIT has been to build a CONTIG map of the mouse
using MIT markers and STSs mapped against a mouse YAC library. This information has been
loaded into MGD and is accessible using the <A HREF="/mldp.html">Mapping Data</A> (formerly Genetic
Mapping Data) query form. A new experiment type, CONTIG, has been added to the
form to enable searching for records of this type. <p>
<p>
The query results summary for contig experiment records is the same as for other
experiment types. The detailed record for a contig shows a list of contigs for
the chromosome, the centimorgan range for the region of the chromosome covered
by the contig, and an ordered set of the STSs mapped within the contig. Each
contig name is linked to another detail record showing the contig segments and
their association with STSs.<p>

<EM>Mouse Physical Map Graphic Displays</EM><BR>

MGD provides a new map display for the MIT physical mapping data. On this
display, contigs are set against the backdrop of the MIT genetic map.
The density of markers dictates a multi-page map of each chromosome. At the
left of each page is shown a graphic of the whole chromosome with vertical
lines representing the arrangement of contigs. A grey box on the chromosome
indicates the region of the chromosome on the page currently displayed. 
<P>
To the right of this small graphic is the enlarged view of the chromosomal
region with centimorgan scale and genetically mapped MIT markers. To the
right of this genetic map are shown the contigs. Each contig has black or
red boxes denoting the location of MIT markers in the contig. (Black boxes
indicate agreement while red boxes indicate conflict between the genetic and 
physical ordering of the markers.) The MIT marker symbols are hyper-linked 
to MGD marker records; the contig names are linked to MGD mapping data records for the contigs.
<p>
The physical map displays are accessed under <A HREF="/maptools.html">Maps and Mapping Data</A> searches.
The files are in Web Map format for display in a browser window.<p>
<p>
<h3>MGI Accession IDs</h3>
MGD has a new accession ID format. All records in the database are now assigned
an ID of the format: <b>MGI:####</b>, where #### can be a number from 1-up. J
numbers continue to be assigned to all references in MGD and can be used for
searching the database. The format for J numbers has been changed to
<b>J:####</b>. If you search using a J number, you must include the "J:"
prefix. In addition, older format accession IDs (e.g., MGD-MRK-####,
MGD-CREX-####) assigned to markers and mapping experiment records prior to
Release 3.3 are retained in the database and can be used for searching. With
the exception of references, which are assigned both J numbers and MGI
accession IDs, all new MGD records are assigned only MGI accession IDs. The new
format goes hand-in-hand with restructuring of the database tables to provide
more streamlined handling of accession numbers and facilitate the creation of
links between MGD and other scientific databases.<p>

<EM>Accession ID Query Form</EM><br>
The <A HREF="/accession.html">Accession ID</A> query form enables you to search for records in MGD by an MGI Accession ID,
older format MGD accession ID, or by any foreign accession ID stored in MGD.
You can enter a single ID, multiple IDs, or specify a range of IDs. For
example, if you search by Genbank ID "M22381", you will see a list of MGD
probe/segment records, each of which includes this Genbank ID. Each item in the
list provides a link to the MGD record for the probe/segment as well as a link
to the related sequence record in Genbank, GSDB, EMBL and DDBJ. Results can be
displayed either as hypertext tables or pre-formatted text.<p>

<EM>Accession ID Fields on Other MGD Query Forms</EM><br>
The database supports a generalized concept of accession ID so that you can use
the accession ID field on a query form to search by any MGI or foreign
accession ID that might relate to the kind of MGD record represented by the
query form. For example, on the <A HREF="/mbib.html">References</A> query form, in the <b>Reference
Accession ID</b> field you can enter either an MGI Accession ID, a J number, or
a Medline ID to search for an MGD reference record.<p>
<p>
You can enter a single accession ID, multiple IDs, or specify a range of IDs.
The query results for any data retrieved from MGD now include MGI accession
IDs, old-format MGD IDs, and any foreign accession IDs associated with the
record. <p>
<p>
<H3>Molecular Probes and Segments</H3>
<b></b>MGD records for primers have been merged with records for probes, clones
and ESTs. The enlarged data set is named "Molecular Probes and Segments." The
PCR Primers query form has been removed. The Probes and Clones query form has
been renamed "<A HREF="/probe.html">Molecular Probes and Segments</A>" query form. <b>Primer</b> has been
added to the selection list for the Sequence Type field on this form to
facilitate searching specifically for primer records.(<b>EST</b> has also been
added to that selection list to facilitate searching for EST records.)<p>

The <b>Primer1, Primer2</b> name fields which appeared on the PCR Primers query
form do not appear on the Molecular Probes and Segments query form, nor do
these names appear in query results for primer records.
<p>
<H3>Updates to DNA Mapping Panel Data Sets</H3>
The following DNA mapping panel data sets have been updated in MGD 3.3:<p>
<UL>
<LI>JAX (BSB): (C57BL/6J x M. spretus)F1 x C57BL/6J
<LI>JAX (BSS): (C57BL/6JEi x SPRET/Ei)F1 x SPRET/Ei
<LI>EUCIB (BSB): (C57BL/6J x SPR or SEG/Pas)F1 x C57BL/6J
<LI>EUCIB (BSS): (C57BL/6J x SPR or SEG/Pas)F1 x SPR or SEG/Pas
<LI>Seldin: (C3H/HeJ-Fasl&lt;gld&gt; x M. spretus)F1 x C3H/HeJ-Fasl&lt;gld&gt;
</UL>

<p>
<H3>Other Changes to Forms and Query Results</H3>

<EM>New Field on Linkage Map Form</EM><br>
The <A HREF="/map.html">Linkage Map</A> form now provides an option to "Select markers with name
containing" some string of characters. For example, suppose you want to see the
mapping positions for all histocompatibility loci assigned to Chromosome 4. You would select
Chromosome 4 and type "histo" on the new field and run the query. The resulting
map would include only markers on Chr 4 whose names contain the letters "histo."
<p>
<EM>PCR Primers Query Form Removed</EM><br>
The PCR Primer query form has been dropped from MGD. You may use the <A HREF="/probe.html">Molecular
Probes and Segments</A> query form to search for primers.<p>
<p>
<p>
<EM>New Links to External Databases</EM><p>
<p>
<A HREF="http://locus.jouy.frlcgi-bin/bovmap/into2.pl">BovMap</A><br>
MGD links to the bovine genome mapping project database, BovMap, through
homologies<p>
<p>
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/index.html">dbEST</A>, <A HREF="http://genome.wustl.edu/est/esthmpg.html">WashU</A>, <A HREF=" http://www-bio.llnl.gov/bbrp/bbrp.homepage.html">LLNL</A>, <A HREF="http://www.atcc.org/">ATCC</A><br>
MGD links to these databases via EST records and related clone records.<br>
