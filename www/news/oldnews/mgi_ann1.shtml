The MGI Web site provides integrated access to various information 
resources on the genetics and biology of the laboratory mouse, 
including the Mouse Genome Database (MGD), the Gene Expression Database 
(GXD) and the Encyclopedia of the Mouse Genome (<EM>Encyclopedia</EM>).

<H3>New Features</H3> 

<H4>Reorganization of the Web Interface</H4>
A new <A HREF="/index.html">MGI home page</A> consolidates access to 
MGI data resources. A set of menus organizes searching options under 
various biological topics. A <EM>Query Menu</EM> window, displayed 
separately from the main browser window, provides direct links to all 
MGI query forms. 

<p>
<EM>Searches, Data and Reports</EM><BR>
The <EM>Searches, Data and Reports</EM> section of the MGI home page 
includes a list of biological topics which link to a new type of 
menu.  When you select a topic and open a menu,  all the available 
options for retrieving information related to the selected biological 
area are displayed. For example, if you select the link to <EM>
<A HREF="/mrktools.html">Genetic and Phenotypic Data</A></EM>, you 
will see a list of the query forms (each with a brief description) that 
enable you to search for information on markers and phenotypes, 
a list of relevant database reports available; and a list of related resources.

<p>
<EM>Query Menu</EM><BR>
While the new menus described above organize database access with respect 
to biological topics, a new <EM><A HREF="/query_menu.html" 
TARGET="menu_window" onClick="QueryMenu()">Query Menu</EM></A> provides direct 
links to the MGI query forms. When you open the <EM>Query Menu</EM>,  
a small window is displayed on your desktop separate from the browser 
window.  This menu shows the list of MGI query forms. When you click on 
a form title, the form opens in the browser window from which you 
selected the <EM>Query Menu</EM>. (<B>Note</B>: <EM>This feature works
best with <B>Java Script</B> enabled</EM>.) 

<H4><A HREF="/estclone.html">cDNA and EST Expression Query Form</A></H4>
This query form enables you to search for cDNA and EST expression 
information related to specified genes and origin (tissue, age, cell line).  

<H4>Oxford Grid Query Form</H4>
A new <EM><A HREF="/oxford.html">Oxford Grid</A></EM> form now 
provides the option to retrieve an <EM>Oxford Grid</EM> display 
of homology between the genomes of two selected species. The 
<EM>Oxford Grid</EM> display also provides links to graphical comparative 
maps showing either a complete map or a region of a mouse chromosome 
with homologies from the selected comparison species. (This feature 
only applies to queries which include mouse as a species for comparison.) 


<H3>Enhancements</H3>

<H4>Query Forms Reformatted</H4>
The form fields have been reformatted to accommodate differences 
between Netscape and Internet Explorer. In addition, selection 
lists on several query forms now have a default value of <b>ANY</b> 
to accommodate Internet Explorer's implementation of selection lists.

<H4>Changes to <A HREF="/homology.html">Mammalian Homology Query Form</A> 
and Query Results</H4>
You can now search for homologies using multiple gene symbols. 
Homology query results have been reorganized to have a more compact, 
tabular format with a link to <B>References</B> appearing at the 
bottom of each displayed homology class. In addition, a link to a 
graphical <b>Comparative map</B> is shown for queries that specify mouse 
as one of the species to compare.  Each comparative map shows the region 
of a mouse chromosome within 2 cM of the selected mouse marker and shows 
any homologies in that region for the comparison species.
