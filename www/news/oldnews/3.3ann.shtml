MGD 3.3 Release Announcement</H2>

<H3><em>June 12, 1997</em></H3>
<p>
<H3>Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) Data</H3>
Records for 170,000 ESTs and the clones from which they are derived have
been entered in MGD and are now accessible using the Molecular Probes and
Segments (formerly Probes and Clones) query form. The information displayed for
each EST includes EST name; MGI accession ID as well as hyperlinked accession
IDs to WashU, GenBank and dbEST; link to the record for the clone from which
the EST is derived; marker symbol for the gene (if any) with which the EST has
been putatively associated.
 <p>
<H3><A HREF="http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/mouse/index">MIT</A> Mouse Physical Mapping Data</H3>
An ongoing project at MIT has been to build a CONTIG map of the mouse
using MIT markers and STSs mapped against a mouse YAC library. This information
has been loaded into MGD and is accessible using the <A HREF="/mldp.html">Mapping Data</A> (formerly
Genetic Mapping Data) query form. A new experiment type, <B>CONTIG</B>, has been added
to the form to enable searching for records of this type.
<p>
<H3>MGI Accession ID</H3>
All records in MGD have been assigned new MGI Accession IDs. The format is
<B>MGI:####</B> where #### can be any number from 1-up. Currently, references are
still assigned J numbers. The older format MGD accession numbers assigned to
marker and mapping experiment records are retained in the database. So, if you
see an accession number such as "MGD-MRK-1330" mentioned in a publication, you
can still use this number to search MGD for the record. The older format MGD
accession numbers for probes and clones have been replaced by MGI accession IDs.
<p>
<H3><A HREF="/accession.html">Accession ID Query Form</A></H3>
<b></b>This new query form enables you to search for records in MGD by an MGI
or MGD accession number, or by any foreign accession ID stored in MGD. For
example, if you search by the GenBank ID "M22381", you will retrieve a listing
of all probes in MGD related to this sequence. The MGD listing also provides a
link to the external database from which the foreign accession ID originates.
<p>
<H3>Accession ID Fields on Other MGD Query Forms</H3>
The database supports a generalized concept of accession ID so that you can use
the Accession ID field on a query form to search by any type of Accession ID
that might relate to an MGD record. For example, on the <A HREF="/mbib.html">References</A> query form,
in the <B>Reference Accession ID</B>  field you can enter either an MGI Accession ID, a J number, or a Medline ID to search for an MGD reference record. <p>
<p>
<A HREF="/probe.html"><H3>Molecular Probes and Segments</A> Query form</H3>
The "PCR Primers" query form has been dropped from the MGD interface and the "Probes and Clones" query form has been renamed Molecular Probes and Segments query form. The database tables for primers and probes have been merged and both kinds of records are searchable using this form. <B>Primer</B> has
been added to the <B>Sequence type</B> selection list on this form to enable
searching specifically for primers. In addition, the records for ESTs and the
clones from which they derive are searchable using this form.<p>

<H3>New Field on <A HREF="/map.html">Linkage Map</A> Query Form</H3>
The Linkage Map query form now provides an option to "Select markers
with name containing" some string of characters. For example, suppose you want
to see the mapping positions for all kinases assigned to Chromosome 2. You
would select Chromosome 2 and type "kinase" on the new field and run the query.
The resulting map would include only markers whose name contain the letters
"kinase."<p>

<H3>New Links to External Databases</H3>

<A HREF="http://locus.jouy.inra.fr/cgi-bin/bovmap/intro2.pl">BovMap</A>: MGD provides links to  BovMap through homology records.<br>

<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/index.html">dbEST</A>, <A HREF="http://genome.wustl.edu/est/esthmpg.html">WashU</A>: MGD links to these resources through EST records. <br>

<A HREF=" http://www-bio.llnl.gov/bbrp/bbrp.homepage.html">LLNL</A>, <A HREF="http://www.atcc.org/">ATCC</A>: MGD links to these resources through EST clone records.<br><p>
