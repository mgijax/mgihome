<h2>MGD 3.1 Update Release Notes<BR><EM>October 1, 1996</EM></h2>  

NOTE: <I><B>If you have used MGD recently, be sure to clear your browser cache before attempting to use the updated MGD.</B></I>
<P>

<B><A HREF="/nomen/">Mouse Nomenclature Guidelines & Locus Symbol Registry</A></B><P>
The Mouse Nomenclature Guidelines and Locus Symbol Registry page
provides contact information for the MGD Mouse Nomenclature Committee 
and links to a membership list of the International Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice.
<P>

A form is now available which enables you to <A HREF="/nomen/nomen_submit.html">
submit a proposed locus</A> symbol via E-mail.
Instructions for doing so are provided in the <EM>Nomenclature Checklist.</EM> 
In addition, you can select links to various databases 
to check current information on existing symbols.
<P>

The <EM>Mouse Nomenclature Rules and Guidelines</EM> document has been 
edited and reformatted to make it much easier to use. A table of
contents has been added.

<STRONG>New full-text search engine:  Glimpse
</STRONG><P>

Glimpse replaces WAIS as the full-text searching engine in MGD and the GXD 
Index.  This change affects the following forms:


<UL>
<LI>Reference and GXD Index query forms - Abstract field
<LI>Genes, Markers, and Phenotypes query form - Phenotype (MLC) search term field
<LI>M. Festing's Inbred Strains query form
<LI>MLC/OMIM query form
</UL>
<P>
Glimpse enhancements to full-text searching in MGI resources:
<UL>
<LI><EM>Glimpse retrieves ALL records matching the search criteria</EM>
<BR>Previously, a WAIS full-text search would discount some
records and not return them in a search. Glimpse searches the
entire data set and retrieves all records containing the terms
in the search string. 
<P>

<LI><EM>Glimpse sorts results alphabetically by symbol or by author</EM>
<BR>Glimpse does not score or rank results according to relevance.
Query results are displayed as a numbered list sorted alphabetically
by Author or Symbol.  
<P>

There are exceptions to this. When a search uses a full-text search 
field in combination with other fields on the query form, the sort 
options selected for the form override glimpse sorting. For example,
on the Reference query form, if you search for all records where
<PRE>
	Title CONTAINS serological
	AND
	Phenotype (MLC) search term = blood 
	<EM>and you select to</EM> 
	SORT by J number
</PRE>

the results will be sorted by J number and not by Author.
<P>
In MLC/OMIM searches, OMIM searches are managed by the IRX full-text
search engine and OMIM results are ranked by relevance.

<P>
<LI><EM>Glimpse  provides wildcard search option</EM>
<BR>Glimpse uses the asterisk(*) wildcard which can be placed at the
end of a partial term, or inside a search term.  For example,
"membran*" or "myelo*sis."
<P>
WAIS, the search engine used previously to Glimpse, used word-stemming
so that, if you entered a term such as "membrane," the search would
retrieve records that contain "membrane," "membranous," "transmembrane."
Glimpse does not do wordstemming but relies on the wildcard to retrieve
the various spellings of a term.
</UL><P>

<B>NOTE:</B> <I>Be sure to read updated <A HREF="/doc/textsearch.html">help text</A> on full-text searching in MGD and GXD.</I>
<P>

<STRONG>Chromosome Committee Reports</STRONG>
<P>

Some of the <A HREF="/bin/ccr/current/index">1996 Chromosome Committee 
Reports</A> are now available on-line. In addition, a new editing interface 
will enable the Chromosome Committees to submit and update their files 
electronically. This form requires a username and password and is 
accessible by members of the Chromosome Committees. 
<P>

<STRONG>Changes to Query Forms and Web Pages</STRONG><P>
<UL>
<LI>The <EM><A HREF="/mgd.html">MGD Home Page</A></EM> has been revised with some links
reworded to reflect changes in MGD and a section has been added

simplified and standardized.
<LI>On all query forms, the <strong>Do Query</strong> button is now 
the <strong>Retrieve</strong> button.
