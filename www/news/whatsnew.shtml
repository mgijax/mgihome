		<dt>MGI is pleased to announce a new implementation of comparative genome data. Previously we used the classic one-to-one orthology relationship between a mouse gene and that of another mammalian species. MGI now uses homology class data from HomoloGene and can support a "many-to-many" relationship between mouse genes and their vertebrate homologs. Chicken, zebrafish and rhesus macaque homologs are newly included in this release as well as human, chimpanzee, dog, cattle and rat. </dt>
		<dt>Vertebrate Homology Class pages include EntrezGene links, Genetic Location and sequence information. See this <a href="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->homology/36030">complement component</a> Vertebrate Homology Class page for an example.</dt>

		<dt>MGI now integrates phenotype data from high-throughput phenotyping centers with curated data from scientific publications, providing comprehensive comparative phenotypes for mouse mutants. Current data sets include those from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI) and the Europhenome (EuPh) data. This integration allows specific comparisons between different Center data interpretations and is a model for future MGI data integration from the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC). All data on the MGI website are refreshed weekly.
		</dt>
		<dt>MGI Allele Summary Pages have been streamlined, concatinating biological systems where phenotypes have been detected while removing the details of each genotype examined. In addition, Allele Detail pages have been redesigned for clarity and performance, and to display results from these high-throughput phenotyping centers. Sex-specific phenotype data also are easier to discover.
