<H3><DT><A HREF="2.4announce.shtml">MGI Release 2.4 Announcement</A></DT></H3>
<!-- this is the link to the mgi release 2.4 page -->
<DD>MGI Release 2.4 is now available. Information on other
<a href="news.shtml">recent MGI releases</A> is also available.</DD>
<!--this is the link to the chronology of MGI releases.-->

<h3><dt>You can <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/searches/allele_form.shtml">search for alleles</A></dt></h3>
<!-- this is the link to the alleles query form -->
<DD>The way MGI handles allele information is changing radically. In MGI 2.4, some of the groundwork has been done resulting in a new <a
href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/searches/allele_form.shtml">Alleles query form</A> and changes in the way allele information is displayed. See, for example, the <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele.cgi?24">detailed
record for a<SUP>twp</A></SUP>, an allele of a.</DD>
<!----------------->

<h3><dt>Combined Name/Symbol Search Field On MGI Query Forms</h3>
<DD>The marker symbol and marker name fields on MGI query forms have been 
combined in one field, <b>Symbol/Name</b>. When using this field, your 
search (by default) spans current symbols or names, withdrawn symbols or
names, and <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/glossary.shtml#synonym">synonyms</A>.
You have the option to limit the search to current symbols only (no search of
names), current symbols and names only, or to current and withdrawn symbols or
names.  <p>
You can enter one or more symbols or names in this field. The search will
retrieve any records for markers having names or symbols that match the
characters entered on the Symbol/Name field. <p>

<DD>The combined Symbol/Name field appears in the following query forms:<p>
<ul><A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/searches/marker_form.shtml"> Genes, Markers and Phenotypes<br></A>
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele_form.shtml"> Alleles<br></A>
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/polymorphism_form.shtml"> Polymorphisms</A><br>
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/probe_form.shtml">Molecular Probes and Segments</A><br>

</ul>

<h3><dt><A HREF="../GO/ontology.shtml">Gene Ontology Project</A></dt></h3>
<!-- this is the link to the gene ontology project -->
<DD>The goal of the <A HREF="../GO/ontology.shtml">Gene Ontology (GO)
Project</A> is to produce controlled vocabularies that can be applied to all
eukaryotes as knowledge of gene and protein roles in cells is accumulating and
changing.  MGI is committed to annotating gene records using GO vocabularies.
To date, close to 5000 genes in MGI have been annotated. GO classification
fields have been added to the following MGI query forms: 


<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker_form.shtml">Genes, Markers and Phenotypes</A>,
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/expression_form.shtml">Gene Expression Data</A>,
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/estclone_form.shtml">cDNA Clone</A> and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/linkmap_form.shtml">Linkage Maps</A>.<P>

	Consortium</A> for more information.</DD>
<!----------------->

<h3><dt>Search <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/probe_form.shtml">Molecular Probes and Segments</A>
by Chromosome Region</dt></h3>
<DD>You can now limit your search for molecular
probes and segments to a specified chromosomal region. 
You also have the option to return results from this form as
<b>tab-delimited text</b>.</DD>
<!----------------->

<h3><dt><A HREF="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->userdocs/glossary.shtml">MGI Glossary</a></dt></h3>
<DD>A
<A HREF="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->userdocs/glossary.shtml">glossary</a> of genetic terms has been added. Genetic terms in the
<A HREF="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->userdocs/helpdocs_menu.shtml">help documents</A> are linked to their definitions in the glossary.</DD>

<!----------------->

<h3><dt>Primary Reference For Sequence IDs</dt></h3>
<DD>An MGI marker record may include a list of related Sequence IDs. Most often, this association is made via molecular segments whose sequence is known and which have been mapped to the given mouse marker.  This association of marker and sequence is reported in the literature. Now, the reference supporting this association is displayed next to the Sequence ID in the marker detail record.</DD>
