<dl>
<dt><h4><a name="genefamily"></a>Late November: Gene Families</h4>
<dd>New members of gene families are being added rapidly. Mouse Genome Informatics 
Nomenclature Committee and HUGO are working with 
researchers to organize and update nomenclature on important gene family groups.
You can now access information about these gene families in MGI. See
 <a href="../nomen/genefamilies/index.shtml">Links to Nomenclature Web Resources for Gene Families.
<dt><h4>Late October: Allele and Mutant Data</h4>
<dd>The new <a href="../nomen/allmut_form.shtml">Allele and New Mutant Submissions 
Form</a> is available for contributing data to MGD. 
Information can be submitted for new or known alleles of existing genes or alleles 
where a phenotype has now identified a new gene. 
Help with nomenclature is provided from linked pages. 
Each new allele or mutant receives a permanent database accession ID.  
<I>Mammalian Genome</I> periodically  publishes a list enumerating the data electronically 
submitted to MGD, including accession ID, chromosome, and locus and allele symbols as a 
cross-referencing service for readers. For submission of other types of data to MGD, see the 
 <a href="../submissions/submissions_menu.shtml">Data and Nomenclature Submissions</a> page.

<dt><h4>Mid-October: <A HREF="2.5announce.shtml">MGI Release 2.5 Announcement</A></h4>
<!-- this is the link to the mgi release 2.5 page -->
<dd>MGI Release 2.5 is now available. Information on other
<a href="news.shtml">recent MGI releases</A> is also available.
<!--this is the link to the chronology of MGI releases.-->

<h4><dt>New MGI Vocabulary Browsers</h4>
<!---->
<dd>You can now view and query the following structured vocabularies: 
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="<!--#include file="include/go_url.html"-->">Gene Ontology (GO) Browser</a>
<p>
The GO Browser associates each ontology term with a precise definition 
of that term, complete with citations and  synonyms. 
Each ontology is organized as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). 
Terms in this hierarchy are organized from the general to the specific 
and you can immediately visualize their relationship. Although the structure of the DAG 
is "tree-like," a term may actually have more than one parent and appear several times
in the browser. A given term may occur in any or all of the following categories:
<p>
<ul>
<b><a href="<!--#include file="include/go_url.html"-->GO.cgi?id=GO:0003674">
Molecular Function</a></b> - Tasks performed by individual gene products. 
Examples: transcription factor; DNA helicase.<br>
<b><a href="<!--#include file="include/go_url.html"-->GO.cgi?id=GO:0008150">
Biological Process</b></a> - Broad biological goals accomplished by ordered assemblies 
of molecular functions. Examples: mitosis; purine metabolism.<br>
<b><a href="<!--#include file="include/go_url.html"-->GO.cgi?id=GO:0005575">
Cellular Component</b></a> - Subcellular structures, locations, and macromolecular 
complexes. Examples: nucleus; telomere; origin recognition complex.<br>
</ul>
<!--As of September, there are approximately 4800 terms in the GO. In MGD, 
approximately 5300 mouse genes are associated with at least one GO term.-->
<p>
<li><a href="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->searches/anatdict_form.shtml">Mouse Anatomical Dictionary
</a>
<p>The Anatomical Dictionary is a vocabulary comprised of 28 Theiler stages. 
Each Theiler stage is a tree which is a subvocabulary of the Dictionary. 
There are brief stage descriptions next to each stage name.
You can select one or more of 
the Theiler stages to focus a search on a particular stage of embryonic development
</ul>
<h4><dt>Homology Maps</a></h4>
<dd>This release includes a new way of viewing and accessing homology data. 
Two new maps are available showing global views of human and rat orthology data 
plotted against the mouse genome. Beside each chromosome is a set of histograms, 
 each corresponding to a human or rat chromosome. The histogram effectively shows 
 the density of known orthologies in a particular mouse chromosomal region. As always, the 
maps are active. <ul><li>You can click on a mouse chromosome to retrieve a detailed linkage map 
showing all orthologs.
<li>You can click on a histogram to retrieve a compact tabular listing of orthologs for 
that part of a chromosome.
</ul>
<p>The following whole genome homology maps are available:
<ul>
<li><a href="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->
reports/homologymap/mouse_human.shtml"> 
human on mouse background</a>
 <li><a href="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->reports/homologymap/mouse_rat.shtml">
rat on mouse background</a>
</ul>
<h4><dt>Expanded MGI Glossary</h4>
<dd><p>We have expanded the 
<a href="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->userdocs/glossary.shtml">
MGI Glossary</a>. 
The Glossary contains terms useful in understanding mouse genetics.
You can find terms defined in a general sense as they apply to eukaryotic genetics, 
particularly mouse genetics. You will also find some terms defined as they apply to MGI
(for example, <b>gene</b>). The list of terms included in the Glossary will 
grow with each new release.
<!----------------->

<H4><dt>Mouse/Drosophila Homology Report</H4>

<dd>The list of 
<a href="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->/external/ashburner/mfhomo.shtml">
similarity associations</a> between mouse and <I>Drosophila</I> genes has greatly 
expanded. There are now 3,017 associations between mouse and <I>Drosophila</I> genes.
<h4><dt><A HREF="../lists/lists.shtml">MGI E-Mail List Service</A></h4>
<!-- this is the link to the lyris MGI-list page. -->
<dd>Use the new web interface to MGI-LIST, RAT-LIST, and PHENOME-LIST 
to read or send messages, subscribe or unsubscribe from a list, 
or modify your subscriber options.
