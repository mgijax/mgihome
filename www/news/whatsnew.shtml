This document provides a quick guide to naming mouse genes and genomic sequences. Included are rules for mouse gene symbols, mouse names, chromosome and protein designations, and the gene symbol to use when distinguishing between mRNA, genomic DNA, and cDNA. There is a link to a query form where you can find your favorite symbol quickly, plus links to pages with more comprehensive material on the genes given as examples, as well as to the full text of the <a href="../nomen/table.shtml">Mouse Nomenclature Rules and Guidelines</a>.<br><br>

  <dd><li>A new <a href="../nomen/allmut_form.shtml">Allele and New Mutant Submissions Form</a> 
  is available for contributing data to MGD. Information can be submitted for new or known alleles of 
  existing genes or alleles where a phenotype has now identified a new gene. Help with nomenclature 
  is provided from linked pages. Each new allele or mutant receives a permanent database accession ID. 
  <I>Mammalian Genome</I> periodically  publishes a list enumerating the data electronically submitted 
  to MGD, including accession ID, chromosome, and locus and allele symbols as a cross-referencing 
  service for readers. For submission of other types of data to MGD, see the
   <a href="../submissions/submissions_menu.shtml">Data and Nomenclature Submissions</a> page.</dd>
