<li><B><a href="../other/mgi_jobs.shtml#profopp">Scientific Curation Positions Available at MGI</B></a><br>
<P>Professional positions are available as Scientific Curators in the expanding Mouse Genome Informatics Programs at The
Jackson Laboratory working with the Mouse Genome Database, Gene Expression Database, Mouse Sequence Database,
Gene Ontology Project and Rat Genome Database Collaboration. Successful candidates will be primarily responsible for data
acquisition and analysis, evaluating and annotating data to be incorporated into the databases, integrating information from
disparate sources, and interacting with research laboratories and genome centers to facilitate data transfer. In addition,
Curators take part in database and interface design by contributing biological perspectives to new data content and displays.
Specific areas of preferred expertise are detailed for each project below. Other desirable attributes include excellent writing /
communication skills and the ability to work effectively in a team environment. Ph.D. degree in Life Sciences or M.S. with
appropriate experience required.</P>
 <UL>
   <LI><B>Mouse Genome Database (MGD) Project</B> - Applicants with strong backgrounds in mammalian genetics and comparative
genomics or in the use of mouse mutants as models of human disease preferred. MGD integrates a wide range mouse genetic,
genomic and phenotypic data, including gene characterization, gene localization and sequence, homologies and comparative
mapping among mammals, phenotype characteristics, allelic variants and mutants, and strain data.</LI><br><br>
   <LI><B>Gene Expression Database (GXD) Project</B> - Applicants with strong backgrounds in molecular and developmental biology and
anatomy preferred. GXD integrates different types of gene expression information from the laboratory mouse and places them in
the larger biological and analytical context via integration with MGD and MGS and by curating links to many other resources.</LI><br><br>
<LI><B>Mouse Genome Sequence (MGS) Project</B> - Applicants with strong sequence and comparative genome analysis experience
preferred. The goal of the MGS project is to integrate emerging mouse genomic sequence data with the genetic and biological
data available in MGD and GXD. MGS supports the MouseBLAST server as a sequence-level entry point into the mouse
database resources.</LI>
<LI><B>Gene Ontology (GO) Project</B> - Applicants with strong biochemistry and cell biology backgrounds and an interest in mammalian
systems preferred. The GO project is a collaborative effort with scientists from other model organism databases to construct
biological ontologies for the annotation of gene and gene products and to use these resources in the mouse databases
resources.</LI><br><br>
<LI><B>Rat Genome Database (RGD) Collaboration</B> - Applicants with strong backgrounds in mammalian genetics and comparative
genomics preferred. RGD is a new genomics database being developed at the Medical College of Wisconsin to support the rat
as a model organism. Our role in this collaboration includes establishing new rat gene nomenclature and curating gene
orthology data for rat, mouse, and human.</LI>

  <dd><li><a name="hmg">The nomenclature for the <a href="../nomen/genefamilies/hmgfamily.shtml">High 
  Mobility Group (HMG)</a> chromosomal proteins has been revised.<br><br>
  
  <dt><a name="genefamily"></a><b>November, 2000</b><br><br>
  <dd><li>New members of <a href="../nomen/genefamilies/index.shtml">gene families</a> are being added 
  rapidly. Mouse Genome Informatics Nomenclature Committee and HUGO are working with researchers to 
  organize and update nomenclature on important gene family groups.<br><br>

  <dd><li>A new <a href="../nomen/allmut_form.shtml">Allele and New Mutant Submissions Form</a> 
  is available for contributing data to MGD. Information can be submitted for new or known alleles of 
  existing genes or alleles where a phenotype has now identified a new gene. Help with nomenclature 
  is provided from linked pages. Each new allele or mutant receives a permanent database accession ID. 
  <I>Mammalian Genome</I> periodically  publishes a list enumerating the data electronically submitted 
  to MGD, including accession ID, chromosome, and locus and allele symbols as a cross-referencing 
  service for readers. For submission of other types of data to MGD, see the
   <a href="../submissions/submissions_menu.shtml">Data and Nomenclature Submissions</a> page.
  
  <!--<h4><dt>New Allele and Mutant Data Submission Form</h4>
<dd>
You can now send MGD mutant allele and mutant data to MGD online. 
Each electronic submission receives a permanent database accession ID.
MGD reference pages provide a link to the associated data sets.
<ul>
<li>You can access the submission form from the 
<a href="../submissions/submissions_menu.shtml">
Data and Nomenclature Submissions</a> menu.
<li>You can find general rules for naming alleles at
