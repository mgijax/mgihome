  <dd><li><a name="hmg">The nomenclature for the <a href="../nomen/genefamilies/hmgfamily.shtml">High 
  Mobility Group (HMG)</a> chromosomal proteins has been revised.<br><br>
  
  <dt><a name="genefamily"></a><b>November, 2000</b><br><br>
  <dd><li>New members of <a href="../nomen/genefamilies/index.shtml">gene families</a> are being added 
  rapidly. Mouse Genome Informatics Nomenclature Committee and HUGO are working with researchers to 
  organize and update nomenclature on important gene family groups.<br><br>

  <dt><a name="allandmut"></a><b>October, 2000</b><br><br>
  <dd><li>A new <a href="../nomen/allmut_form.shtml">Allele and New Mutant Submissions Form</a> 
  is available for contributing data to MGD. Information can be submitted for new or known alleles of 
  existing genes or alleles where a phenotype has now identified a new gene. Help with nomenclature 
  is provided from linked pages. Each new allele or mutant receives a permanent database accession ID. 
  <I>Mammalian Genome</I> periodically  publishes a list enumerating the data electronically submitted 
  to MGD, including accession ID, chromosome, and locus and allele symbols as a cross-referencing 
  service for readers. For submission of other types of data to MGD, see the
   <a href="../submissions/submissions_menu.shtml">Data and Nomenclature Submissions</a> page.
  
  <!--<h4><dt>New Allele and Mutant Data Submission Form</h4>
<dd>
You can now send MGD mutant allele and mutant data to MGD online. 
Each electronic submission receives a permanent database accession ID.
MGD reference pages provide a link to the associated data sets.
<ul>
<li>You can access the submission form from the 
<a href="../submissions/submissions_menu.shtml">
Data and Nomenclature Submissions</a> menu.
<li>You can find general rules for naming alleles at 
<a href="../submissions/submit.shtml">Submitting New Mutant and Allele Data</a>
