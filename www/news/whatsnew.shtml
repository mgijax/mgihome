<H3><dt><A HREF="2.5announce.shtml">MGI Release 2.5 Announcement</A></DT></H3>
<!-- this is the link to the mgi release 2.5 page -->
<dd>MGI Release 2.5 is now available. Information on other
<a href="news.shtml">recent MGI releases</A> is also available.</dd>
<!--this is the link to the chronology of MGI releases.-->

<H3><dt>New MGI Vocabulary Browsers</h3></dt>
<!---->
<dd>You can now view and query the following structured vocabularies: 
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="<!--#include file="include/go_url.html"-->">Gene Ontology (GO) Browser</a>
<p>
The GO Browser associates each ontology term with a precise definition 
of that term, complete with citations and  synonyms. 
Each ontology is organized as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). 
Terms in this hierarchy are organized from the general to the specific 
and you can immediately visualize their relationship. Although the structure of the DAG 
is "tree-like," a term may actually have more than one parent and appear several times
in the browser. A given term may occur in any or all of the following categories:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="<!--#include file="include/go_url.html"-->GO.cgi?id=GO:0003674">
Molecular Function</a></b> - Tasks performed by individual gene products. <br>
Examples: transcription factor; DNA helicase
<li><b><a href="<!--#include file="include/go_url.html"-->GO.cgi?id=GO:0008150">
Biological Process</b></a> - Broad biological goals accomplished by ordered assemblies 
of molecular functions. 
<br>Examples: mitosis; purine metabolism
<li><b><a href="<!--#include file="include/go_url.html"-->GO.cgi?id=GO:0005575">
Cellular Component</b></a> - Subcellular structures, locations, and macromolecular 
complexes. 
<br>Examples: nucleus; telomere; origin recognition complex
</ul>
<!--As of September, there are approximately 4800 terms in the GO. In MGD, 
approximately 5300 mouse genes are associated with at least one GO term.-->
<p>
<li><a href="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->searches/anatdict_form.shtml">Mouse Anatomical Dictionary
</a>
<p>The Anatomical Dictionary is a vocabulary comprised of 28 Theiler stages. 
Each Theiler stage is a tree which is a subvocabulary of the Dictionary. 
There are brief stage descriptions next to each stage name.
You can select one or more of 
the Theiler stages to focus a search on a particular stage of embryonic development
</ul>
</dd>
<h3><dt>Homology Maps</a></dt></h3>
<dd>This release includes a new way of viewing and accessing homology data. 
Two new maps are available showing global views of human and rat orthology data 
plotted against the mouse genome. Beside each chromosome is a set of histograms, 
 each corresponding to a human or rat chromosome. The histogram effectively shows 
 the density of known orthologies in a particular mouse chromosomal region. As always, the 
maps are active. <ul><li>You can click on a mouse chromosome to retrieve a detailed linkage map 
showing all orthologs.
<li>You can click on a histogram to retrieve a compact tabular listing of orthologs for 
that part of a chromosome.
</ul>
<p>The following whole genome homology maps are available:
<ul>
<li><a href="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->reports/homologymap/mouse_human.shtml"> 
human on mouse background</a>
 <li><a href="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->reports/homologymap/mouse_rat.shtml">
rat on mouse background</a>
</ul>
</dd>
<h3><dt>Expanded MGI Glossary</dt></h3>
<dd><p>We have expanded the MGI Glossary. The Glossary contains terms useful in understanding mouse genetics.
You can find terms defined in a general sense as they apply to eukaryotic genetics, 
particularly mouse genetics. You will also find some terms defined as they apply to MGI
(for example, <b>gene</b>). The list of terms included in the Glossary will 
grow with each new release.</dd>

<!--<h3><dt>New Allele and Mutant Data Submission Form</dt></h3>
<dd>
You can now send MGD mutant allele and mutant data to MGD online. 
Each electronic submission receives a permanent database accession ID.
MGD reference pages provide a link to the associated data sets.
<ul>
<li>You can access the submission form from the 
<a href="../submissions/submissions_menu.shtml">
Data and Nomenclature Submissions</a> menu.
<li>You can find general rules for naming alleles at 
<a href="../submissions/submit.shtml">Submitting New Mutant and Allele Data</a>
