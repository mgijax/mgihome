<H2>What's New?</H2>
<h3>Last Updated March 15, 2000</h3>

<H4><A HREF="2.3.2.announcement.shtml">MGI Release 2.3.2</A> is now available.
</H4>
<H4>MGI has a new <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgihome_url.html'-->">MGI Home site</A>.</H4>
We have reorganized our web site a bit so that many files that used to reside 
on all MGI mirror sites now reside only at the home site. Having the home site also allows us to make available new resources between MGI releases. 
<P>
As a result of reorganizing the MGI home site, MGI presents a new main menu accessed through URL: <BR>
http:www.informatics.jax.org. A similar page will be presented at all up-to-date mirror sites.
<P>
<H4>"What's New?" Page</H4>
The "What's New?" page gives us the option 
to inform people about new MGI resources and changes that are  
offered in new releases as well as those that 
become available at other times. This page will change
from time to time, so be sure to check it now and then. 

<H4><A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgihome_url.html'-->/genealogy/">Genealogy Chart</A> of Inbred Strains</H4>
The laboratory mouse is the primary model organism for the study of human biology and disease. Inbred strains of mice represent unique fixed genotypes that can be repeatedly accessed as homogeneous experimental individuals, with predictable phenotypes and defined allelic composition. Hundreds of inbred strains of mice have been described and new strains continue to be developed. The Genealogy Chart of Inbred Strains graphically depicts the origins and relationships of inbred mouse strains. The Genealogy Chart is available as a <A HREF="<!--#include file="include/ftp_url.html"-->pub/informatics/datasets/misc/genealogy/genealogy.pdf">downloadable PDF file</A>. (file size: 4398 Kbytes) 

<H4>The MGI List Service is Now on the Web</H4>
Now, you can access <A HREF="http://lists.informatics.jax.org/lists">
mgi-list or rat-list on the Web</A>.
Several months ago, the MGI list service was switched to a new 
listserver application, Lyris. Now, you can read list mail, send 
a message to a list, subscribe or unsubscribe from a list, or 
modify your subscriber options through this interface. 
<P>
<H4>Not So New...</H4>
Find out about other <A HREF="news.shtml">recent releases of MGI</A>.
<P>
The MGI query interface comes with <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/userdocs/helpdocs_menu.shtml">instructions</A> and, if you have questions, you
can always contact <A HREF="/mgihome/support/tjl_inbox.shtml">User Support</A>.
