<dt><b>SNP data increased 4-fold.</b></dt>
<dt>With this release we increased our SNP records 4-fold to over 66 million. These data include the Sanger MGP (v5) SNP set. Use our preeminent <a href="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->snp" target="_blank">SNP Query</a> to search for SNPs by gene symbols or chromosomal regions across 101 mouse strains. 
Search results are limited to 100,000 SNPs (displayed or downloaded), and filters are available to refine search results that exceed the return limit.</dt>
<dt>To query this large data set efficiently, we implemented the search with Elasticsearch, which allows large data sets to be queried in parallel and improves search speeds. We plan on using this search for other large data sets in MGI/GXD.</dt>
<dt>In order to update the SNP coordinates to GRCm39 we temporarily lost the dbSNP function classes, such as whether the SNP is in an intron or coding region, and therefore, the Function Class filter in a SNP summary report is limited to "within coordinates of." A future release will provide more function classes. 
The function classes for individual SNPs can be found by searching <a href="https://www.alliancegenome.org" target="_blank">The Alliance of Genome Resources</a> with the RefSNP ID, one ID at a time. For queries that specify one or more Reference strains, MGI's Allele Agreement filters restrict results to SNPs with strain allele calls that agree or differ from reference strain alleles.</dt>

<dt><b>MGD 1.0 was released on the World Wide Web 30 years ago.</b></dt>
<dt>The first release of the Mouse Genome Database was launched on the World Wide Web in June of 1994. This release encompassed several projects initiated at The Jackson Laboratory, including GBASE, the Mouse Locus Catalog (MLC), the Mouse Linkage Database and Programs (MLDP), the Homology Database and Programs (HMDP), and probes and PCR databases describing molecular reagents and polymorphisms (MusProb and MusPCR).
 MGD 1.0 combined all of these earlier disparate databases into one coherent system, eliminating redundancy and making possible new data integration and analysis. Also included was the Encyclopedia of the Mouse Genome, a suite of software tools for browsing mouse genetic data and displaying genetic and cytogenetic maps. This application was a finalist for a Computerworld Smithsonian Award for Innovation in Information Technology.</dt>

<dt><b>The Global Biodata Coalition (GBC) designated GXD a Global Core Biodata Resource.</b></dt>

<dt>Global Core Biodata Resources are biodata resources that are of fundamental importance to the wider biological and life sciences community and the long term preservation of biological data. They:
<ul>
<li>provide free and open access to their data,</li>
<li>are used extensively both in terms of the number and distribution of their users,</li>
<li>are mature and comprehensive,</li>
<li>are considered authoritative in their field,</li>
<li>are of high scientific quality, and</li>
<li>provide a professional standard of service delivery.</li>
</ul>
Their operation is based on well-established life-cycle management processes and well-understood dependencies with related data resources. GCBRs have either terms of use or specific licenses that conform to the Open Definition, to enable the reuse of data.
</dt>
<dt>GXD and MGD, the two main components of MGI, are now both designated as GCBRs. <a href="<!--#include file="include/mgihome_url.html"-->news/news_2022.shtml#dec15_2022" target="_blank">MGD was already named a GCBR in 2022</a>.</dt>

<dt><b>Human - Mouse: Disease Connection search refinements.</b></dt>
<dt>The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and Mammalian Phenotype (MP) Ontology are distinct vocabularies that cover similar concepts. With this release, we added a tool to find related terms in the two ontologies, and add these to a Human - Mouse: Disease Connection (<a href="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->diseasePortal" target="_blank">HMDC</a>) phenotype ID search. 
This permits you to find both human and mouse phenotypic results when searching by ID.</dt>
  <dt>Previously, when you used the Human Phenotype Ontology (<a href="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->vocab/hp_ontology" target="_blank">HPO</a>) Browser, and you clicked on the number of annotations, the search forwarded to the HMDC and the search was limited to just human phenotype annotations.
   With this release, however, use the "Click to modify search" button and you will have the option of finding and adding related mammalian phenotype terms to the HMDC search results. </dt>

 <ul>
  <li>A search for Chr XY with the Genes & Markers Query now returns all PAR markers, placed in the PAR by genome coordinates or by genetic mapping. PAR markers with genome coordinates can still be returned by coordinate searches of the corresponding chromosome (X or Y).</li>
  <li>MGI now represents sequence-verified PARX / PARY homologous loci as distinct markers, with Chr X / Chr Y genome coordinates, respectively, and gene detail pages provide links to the Homologous PAR Feature.

<dt>The Multiple Genome Viewer (MGV) now includes 2 <i>Xenopus</i> genomes: the African clawed frog, <i>X. laevis</i>, and the the Western clawed frog, <i>X. tropicalis</i>.
 <i>X. laevis</i> is an allotetraploid (2n = 36) of hybrid origin.  The resulting <i>X. laevis</i> genome has a set of ancestral 'long' (L) and 'short' (S) chromosomes, with extensive L/S homoeology for genes that have been retained on the S subgenome. 
 The <i>X. laevis.L</i> and <i>X. laevis.S</i> subgenomes are represented as separate genomes in the MGV.
