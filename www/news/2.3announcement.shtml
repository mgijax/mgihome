<I>November 29, 1999</I></CENTER>

<H3>Enhanced Display of Homology Information</H3>
The display of homology query results has been reformatted and now contains information on homology criteria and options for viewing references.<P>
Homology information in MGD is extracted from the scientific literature. This information includes the type of experimental evidence used to support homology assertions. Now, MGD homology query results indicate the criteria for homology assertions. Some homologies are reported by a number of sources. There can be a number of different criteria shown for the same set of homologs. See, for example, the<A HREF="../searches/homology_report.cgi?id=MGI:88388"> homology report on the <I>Cftr</I></A> gene. You will see a new <B><A HREF="../userdocs/homology_criteria.shtml">Criteria</A></B> column on the right showing, in this example, several values, AA (Amino acid sequence comparison), CL (Conserved map location) and NT (Nucleotide sequence comparison). <P>
You will also see the <B>Number of References</B> associated with each criterion. The number is linked to the references. Beneath the tabular display of a set of homologies, the <STRONG>References</STRONG> line now provides options to view a list of either all the references for a set of homologies, or, view the references for particular species represented in the set. 

<H3>New Options for Searching Polymorphism Information</H3>
The <A HREF="../searches/polymorphism_form.shtml">Polymorphisms query form</A> now provides the option to search for differences between mouse strains. You enter one or more strains in the <EM>Primary strains</EM> field, enter one or more strains in the <EM>Comparison strains</EM> field, and then execute the search to find the differences between the primary and comparison strains.
<P>
You can now search for polymorphism information in a region of a chromosome by specifying the end-points of the region. You can search for polymorphisms in the area between two markers (using marker symbols), between two cM positions, between a marker and a cM position, or within a specified number of cM around a locus. 
<H3>Mouse Gene Records Now Associated with <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/">Unigene</A> Clusters</H3>
Previously, MGD showed putative associations between mouse genes and ESTs based on information in dbEST records. Now, MGD shows putative associations between genes and I.M.A.G.E. clones based on information in Unigene clusters. In many cases, a MGD mouse gene detail record will include a link to a Unigene cluster in the "Other Database Links" section of the record. See, for example, detail record for <A HREF="../searches/marker.cgi?12181">Pax3</A>
<H3><A HREF="http://mouseblast.informatics.jax.org/prototype/">MouseBLAST Prototype</A></H3></A>
MouseBLAST enables you to compare a DNA or protein sequence against sequence data in one of several rodent sequence databases (all data representing subsets of either GenBank, TrEMBL, or SwissProt). Matching sequence records may include links to GenBank or SwissProt. If a retrieved sequence is associated with a mouse gene, the sequence record will include a link to the appropriate marker detail record in MGD.<P>
MouseBLAST provides a simple search form for searching by sequence or Sequence ID (from GenBank, EMBL, SwissProt, TrEMBL, or GenPept). MouseBLAST relies on several WU-BLAST programs for searching DNA or protein sequences. (WU-BLAST is an implementation of BLAST).

<H3>Enhancements to the Mouse Tumor Biology Database Prototype</H3>
The <A HREF="http://tumor.informatics.jax.org/FMPro?-db=TumorInstance&-format=mtdp.html&-view">Mouse Tumor Biology Database (MTB)</A> prototype provides access to descriptions of tumors and tumor cell lines; tumor pathology reports and images; information on genetic factors associated with tumors and tumor development; tumor incidence and latency data; links to related resources. <P>A new <A HREF="http://tumor.informatics.jax.org/straingrid.html">Tumor Frequency Grid</A> (Inbred Strain x Organ) provides a summary of MTB Tumor Frequency and Incidence records for spontaneous tumors observed in particular strain and organ combinations. This summary, in turn, is linked to the sources of the values used to make this grid. <P>
Also, a new column has been added to the Strain Results page providing links to external resources including the <a href="http://mammary.nih.gov">Biology of the Mammary Gland Web Site</a>.
