<p>MGI is pleased to announce its 2.96 release.<br>
<ul>
<li>We want to hear from you! Please take the time to respond to our 
<a href="../other/mgi_survey.shtml">survey</a> and help us improve MGI resources. </li> <br><br> 


<li>Our new <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/searches/AMA_form.shtml">Adult Anatomy Browser</a> lets you browse or search an ontology describing the anatomy of the adult mouse (Theiler Stage 28). The Browser structure is similar to that of the Gene Ontology (GO) and of the Mammalian Phenotypes (MP). See <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/menus/vocab_menu.shtml">Vocabulary Browsers</a> for more information.
</li><br><br>

<li>A new feature on the 
<a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/searches/marker_form.shtml">Genes and Markers Query Form</a> provides an option to query by Interpro terms.  Any resultant Interpro associations appear on marker detail pages.</li><br><br>

<li>You can also query for markers and clones by IMAGE and RIKEN clone sets from the <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/searches/marker_form.shtml">Genes and Markers Query Form</a>, the <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/searches/probes_form.shtml">Molecular Probes and Clones Query Form</a>, and the <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/searches/estclone_form.shtml">cDNA Clone Query Form</a>.  </li><br><br>


<li>A query from the <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/searches/marker_form.shtml">Genes and Markers Query Form</a> now returns any markers associated (via SWISS-PROT records) with <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/">Protein Data Bank (PDB)</a> accession IDs.</a></li><br><br>

</ul>
