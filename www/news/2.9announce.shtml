<p>The new features of MGI's 2.9 release are: <br><br>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="http://www.ensembl.org/"><b>Ensembl</b></A><br><br>
MGI marker records are now linked to Ensembl mouse gene models that share a common external sequence accession ID with those models. We also obtain chromosome map locations for MGI genes associated with Ensembl gene models. Ensembl is a joint project between the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">European Bioinformatics Institute/European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL-EBI)</a> and the <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</a> <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/">Sanger Institute</a>. 
<br><br>

<li><a href="http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/"><b>CBIL/DoTS</b></a><br><br>
MGI marker records are also linked to computationally derived transcript assemblies from DoTS, the Database Of Transcribed Sequences, developed at the Computational Biology and Informatics Laboratory</a> (CBIL) at the University of Pennsylvania. (See the <a href="http://www.allgenes.org">AllGenes</a> web site for more information). Associations between MGI markers and assemblies are based on shared GenBank sequence accession identifiers.  Only associations between MGI genes and TCs/DTs supported by non-conflicting evidence are accessible for these resources. The links are updated after every major change in MGI databases. 

<br><br>

<li><A HREF="http://www.tigr.org/tdb/tgi/mgi/"><b>TIGR Mouse Gene Index</B></A><br><br>
MGI marker records are linked as well to computationally derived transcript assemblies from the TIGR Mouse Gene Index developed at <a href="http://www.tigr.org/">The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR)</a>. Associations between MGI markers and assemblies are based on shared GenBank sequence accession identifiers. Only associations between MGI genes and TCs/DTs that are supported by non-conflicting evidence are accessible for these resources. The links are updated after each build of TIGR's Mouse Gene Index and after every major change in MGI databases.
