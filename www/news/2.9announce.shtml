<p>MGI is pleased to announce its 2.9 release.<br>
<ul>

  <li>A new toolbar enables you to access query forms, get help, use MouseBLAST, find out more about MGI, discover what's new, and explore our resources.
 <br><br>         
  <li>A new text search tool helps you to locate information in the MGI database quickly. You can search for gene symbols or names, accession IDs, reference abstracts, phenotypes, gene expression data, Gene Ontology (GO) terms, Mouse Anatomical Dictionary structures, Festing's Strain Characteristics, or Mouse Locus Catalog (MLC) text. See <A href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/searchtool_help.shtml">Using the Search Tool</a>.
 <br><br>         
<li>Our redesigned Gene Detail page makes information much more accessible and now includes links to several new reports.                         
  <br><br>                          

<li>MGI marker records are now linked to <A HREF="http://www.ensembl.org/">Ensembl</a> mouse gene models that share a common external sequence accession ID with those models. We also obtain chromosome map locations for MGI genes associated with Ensembl gene models. Ensembl is a joint project between the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">European Bioinformatics Institute/European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL-EBI)</a> and the <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</a> <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/">Sanger Institute</a>. 
<br><br>

<li>
MGI marker records are also linked to computationally derived transcript assemblies from <a href="http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/">CBIL/DoTS</a>, the Database of Transcribed Sequences, developed at the Computational Biology and Informatics Laboratory</a>  at the University of Pennsylvania. (See <a href="http://www.allgenes.org">AllGenes</a> for more information). Associations between MGI markers and assemblies are based on shared GenBank sequence accession identifiers.  Only associations between MGI genes and DTs supported by non-conflicting evidence are accessible for these resources. The links are updated after every major change in MGI databases. 

<br><br>

<li>MGI marker records are linked as well to computationally derived transcript assemblies from the <A HREF="http://www.tigr.org/tdb/tgi/mgi/">TIGR Mouse Gene Index</a> developed at <a href="http://www.tigr.org/">The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR)</a>. Associations between MGI markers and assemblies are based on shared GenBank sequence accession identifiers. Only associations between MGI genes and TCs supported by non-conflicting evidence are accessible for these resources. The links are updated after each build of TIGR's Mouse Gene Index and after every major change in MGI databases.
