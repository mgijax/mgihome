<P>MGI version 3.1 provides the scientific community with the ability to query for genes based on their coordinates in the current mouse genome assembly.</p><P>As a result, you can now use these coordinates to query for:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>sequences using the 
<a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/sequence_form.shtml">Mouse Sequence Query Form</A>. You define attributes or source or certain properties and annotations of associated genes and markers. The search returns sequences associated with markers that overlap or are included by the coordinates you enter in the <B>Genome Coordinates</B> field on the query form.</LI><br>

<LI>sequences associated with markers mapped to a set of assembly coordinates using the 
<a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/sequence_form.shtml">Mouse Sequence Query Form</a>. </li></p>

<LI>markers using the 
<a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker_form.shtml">Genes and Markers Query Form.</a> You enter a chromosome and the coordinates in these fields on the query form.</LI><br>
</ul>


<P>Genome coordinates for genes (as annotated by NCBI or Ensembl) appear on the the MGI gene and sequence summary and detail reports. Information about sequence attributes, such as length, type, strain, and provider descriptions, are also provided. You can have the summary reports sorted by genome coordinate.</P>


<P>When forwarding a genome assembly sequence to MouseBLAST (the sequence similarity server at MGI) or downloading the sequence in FASTA format, you can specify an amount of flanking sequence. Using the MouseBLAST (WU-BLAST 2.0), you can search a sequence within mouse/rodent sequence databases to find matching sequences that may be associated with mouse genes. Any results are linked to MGI mouse gene records.  All sequence databases are updated on a weekly basis.
</P>

<!--you can now elect to sort your output results by Genome Coordinates as along w. the previous choices of Type, Provider, Length, Strain/Species, Tissue, Library, Clone Collection, Marker Symbol, Map Position-->


<!--(old 3.0:MouseBLAST output has been enhanced to allow for easy downloading of the matching sequences. In addition, the results can be resubmitted to BLAST directly from the output. From the MouseBLAST output, a report is provided that summarizes information, such as chromosome location, about the genes and markers with which the sequences are associated in MGI.</P></p>

<!--<P>You can now query for sequences in MGI using biological attributes of genes using the new <a href="#include file='include/wi_url.html'searches/sequence_form.shtml">Mouse Sequence Query Form</a>. The Mouse Sequence Query Form supports such complex queries as "Show me all of the mouse RNA sequences from GenBank that are associated with genes on chromosome 9 where the genes are expressed in the embryo and are annotated to the Gene Ontology term "growth factor." This query will currently return the sequences for 4 genes (Madh3, Bmp5, Tgfbr2, and Nrg4).-->
