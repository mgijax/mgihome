<p>MGI is pleased to announce the release of Version 3.53 of the database.

<ul>
  <li>MGI's newest feature is the association of mutant cell line IDs with MGI markers.  You can now query with the question, <i>Are there any gene traps associated with my gene?</i> To find, for example, the gene traps associated with <i>Adk</i>, follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li>On the MGI <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/java_url.html'-->WIFetch?page=markerQF">Genes and Markers Query Form</a>, enter <i>Adk</i> in the Gene/Marker Symbol/Name field and click <i>Search</i>. The Genes and Markers Query Results -- Summary report appears.</li>
  <li>Locate <i>Adk</i> and click it. The Gene Detail report for <i>Adk</i> appears.
<li>Scroll to  <b>Other Database Links </b> and find the list of mutant cell line identifiers beside <b>Gene Traps</b>. Click to access a given gene trap's report in the dbGSS division of GenBank. <br><b>Note:</b> If there are more than five links associated with a marker, five are listed followed by <i>All</i> (with a count in parentheses),  linked to the   
Gene Traps report. See 
<a href="<!--#include file='include/userdocs_url.html'-->gene_traps_lite_help.shtml">
Interpreting the Gene Traps Report</a> for details.</li>
</ol>
  
<br>You can also use the Search Tool to find these associations. Enter either the mutant cell line identifier (for example, <i> FHCRC-GT-S15-11C1</i>) or the gene symbol/name in the box (on the home page) and click <i>Search</i>.</li><br>

<li>The Gene Expression Database's newest feature is a link to the Edinburgh Mouse Atlas and Gene Expression EMAGE database section browser.   The EMAGE browser contains sections of embryos with labelled anatomical structures.  Clicking on a structure in one of these sections highlights that term in the accompanying hierarchical anatomical term list.  Right (or double) clicking on that term lets you query either the Gene Expression Database (GXD) or the EMAGE database for studies examining gene expression in that structure. Access to the EMAGE browser is from the  <a href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/menus/expression_menu.shtml">Gene Expression</a> menu page.</li>
</ul>
