<p>MGI's 3.54 release features a new <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/java_url.html'-->WIFetch?page=batchQF">batch query tool</a> for accessing information about many genes/markers all at once. 
 <ul>
    <li>Given a set of gene symbols or input identifiers (IDs) (such as MGI accession, RefSNP, or VEGA IDs) from, for example, a spreadsheet, you can copy and paste (or upload a file containing) a column of data into the query tool. </li><br>
  <li>You can specify the output you want in the <a href="#summary">MGI Batch Query Results</a> (for example, nomenclature; genome location; Ensembl, Entrez, or VEGA gene identifiers; gene ontology or mammalian phenotype data; GenBank/RefSeq, UniProt, RefSNP, or MGI Allele IDs).</li><br>

<li>You can also use the batch query to find duplications, ambiguities, and variations in data. You could check, for example, that an input list of MGI identifiers returns the same number of Ensembl, Entrez, and VEGA IDs on any given day, and that switching the input and output IDs returns the identical data.</li><br>

<li>You can view results in either web or tab-delimited format.</li>
</ul>
