<p>MGI is pleased to announce its 3.43 release featuring an updated <A HREF="http://www.informatics.jax.org/javawi2/servlet/WIFetch?page=snpQF">Mouse SNP Query Form</a>. In this version, the genome coordinate discrepancy is resolved. This discrepancy occurred because SNP data for Build 34 of the mouse genome were not available from dbSNP at the time MGI moved to Build 34 gene coordinates. See  <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/snp_discrepancy.shtml">Understanding Mouse SNP Coordinate Discrepancies</a> for further details.</p>

 
<p>This "in sync" release includes over 1,757,816 SNPs for 86 mouse strains from dbSNP build 125, mapped to mouse genome sequence Build 34.  You can:<br>
</p><ul>
  <li>use the Mouse SNP Query Form to search dbSNP for SNPs by strains, strain comparisons, SNP attributes (variation type and functional class), map position, marker range, or
by association to MGI genes and genetic markers.</li>

  <li>view comprehensive data on MGI SNP summary and detail pages.</li>
  <!--<li>search for SNPs within specified distances from a gene of interest.</li>-->
</ul>
<p>Query results include a summary of each returned SNP, including consensus strain allele calls derived from SNP assays. You can: </p><ul>
 <li>choose an output strain sort order.
</li><li>elect to see strain allele calls marked as <i>Same</i> or <i>Different</i> relative to a reference strain. </li>

  <li>use the spreadsheet-compatible tab-delimited option for displaying SNP
query results and visualizing presumptive haplotype blocks. </li>
</ul>
<p>You can perform queries such as:
</p><ul>
  <li>Show me all SNPs on Chromosome 1 with genome coordinates between 161079124 and 161984763 <!--D1Mit30 and D1Mit37--> that are different between  C57BL/6J and DBA/2 mice. </li>

<li>Return all SNPs, searching A/J, C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, C3H/HeJ, and CZECHII/EiJ, for any marker symbol/name beginning with <i>pax</i>.</li>

<li>Compare A/HeJ, A/J, BALB/cJ, C3H/HeJ, SM/J, 129S1/SvImJ, AKR/J,
DBA/2J, LP/J, NZB/BlNJ and NZW/LacJ strains with C57BL/6J on Chromosome
1, and display all variation alleles with nonsynonymous substitutions.</li>

</ul>




<!--<p>The Mouse SNPs Detail page provides comprehensive information about each SNP including the reference flanking sequence, assays that comprise the SNP, gene/marker associations with their corresponding function class annotations, and links to popular gene browsers including MGI Mouse Browse, with MGI-curated phenotype and allele tracks in addition to transcript and gene model tracks.</p>-->

<p>MGI is the community model organism database for the laboratory mouse.
