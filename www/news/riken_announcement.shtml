<p>In collaboration with the Genome Exploration Research Group of the RIKEN Institute of Physical and Chemical 
Research in Japan, Mouse Genome Informatics is pleased to announce the release of
information regarding 21,076 mouse cDNA clones. These clones were isolated and sequenced at the 
RIKEN Institute as part of their Mouse Genome Encyclopedia, a genomics project centered on the 
production of full-length mouse cDNAs. 

<p>The RIKEN Institute hosted a meeting for first-pass functional annotation of these cDNAs 
(Functional Annotation of Mouse, FANTOM), attended by an international assembly of mammalian
biologists and bioinformaticians. An overview of these clone annotations appears in the 
summary publication for this meeting. The reference is:
<blockquote>
  The RIKEN Genome Exploration Research Group Phase II Team and the FANTOM Consortium. 
  Functional annotation of a full-length mouse cDNA collection.  Nature 409: 685-690.(8 February 2001)
  (J:65060).
</blockquote>

<p>RIKEN clone annotations are fully integrated into MGI and are accessible through standard query 
forms. Each clone from this data set is represented by a Molecular Probes and Segments record and 
is associated with a gene in MGD. These cDNAs represent a total of 15,294 genes, 12,905 of which are 
new genes to MGI. Incorporation of these clones has expanded the representation of 
mouse genes in the MGI databases significantly. 

<p>New mouse genes discovered in the RIKEN clone set are assigned official nomenclature in MGI 
following a defined syntax. Gene Symbols are derived from RIKEN clone identifiers followed by 
"Rik" (for example, 2610307C23Rik). Gene names are of the form "Riken cDNA" (Riken Clone Identifier)
"gene" (for example, Riken cDNA 2610307C23 gene). For novel genes represented by multiple RIKEN clones that show sequence
overlap (clusters), nomenclature comes from the clone identifier of the representative clone for each 
cluster. As these new mouse genes become better characterized, revised nomenclature and other 
biologicaldata will be incorporated regularly. 

<p>The gene count for this clone set reflects the current state of annotation for these clones and is 
an overestimate due to some unresolved redundancy. Sequence information for all but approximately 1900 
of these clones has been released through the DNA DataBank of Japan (DDBJ).
