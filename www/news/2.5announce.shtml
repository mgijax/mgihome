MGI Release 2.5 Announcement</h2>

<H3>New MGI Vocabulary Browsers</h3>
<!--<p>Vocabulary browsers allow you view and navigate large collections of terms, 
as well as search them for detailed information.-->
<p>From the MGI Home Page, you can now view and query the following structured vocabularies: 
<ul>
<li><a href="<!--#include file="include/go_url.html"-->GO/go_url.html">Gene Ontology (GO) Browser</a><p>
The GO Browser associates each ontology term with a precise definition 
of that term, complete with citations and  synonyms. 
Each ontology is organized as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). 
Terms in this hierarchy are organized from the general to the specific 
and you can immediately visualize their relationship. However, even though the structure of the DAG 
is "tree-like," a term may actually have more than one parent and appear several times
in the browser. A given term may occur in any or all of the following categories:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="<!--#include file="include/go_url.html"-->GO.cgi?id=GO:0003674">
Molecular Function</a></b> - Tasks performed by individual gene products. <br>
Examples: transcription factor; DNA helicase
<li><b><a href="<!--#include file="include/go_url.html"-->GO.cgi?id=GO:0008150">
Biological Process</b></a> - Broad biological goals accomplished by ordered assemblies 
of molecular functions. 
<br>Examples: mitosis; purine metabolism
<li><b><a href="<!--#include file="include/go_url.html"-->GO.cgi?id=GO:0005575">
Cellular Component</b></a> - Subcellular structures, locations, and macromolecular 
complexes. 
<br>Examples: nucleus; telomere; origin recognition complex
</ul>
<p>As of September, there are approximately 4800 terms in the GO. In MGD, 
approximately 5300 mouse genes are associated with at least one GO term.
You can use the GO Browser to query for MGI genes, gene expression data, or cDNA clones, 
and focus your searches on genes annotated using these terms. 
<p>
<li><a href=anatDictionary/indes.shtml>Mouse Anatomical Dictionary</a><br>
<p>The Anatomical Dictionary is a vocabulary comprised of 28 Theiler stages. 
Each Theiler stage is a tree which is a subvocabulary of the Dictionary. 
There are brief stage descriptions next to each stage name.<p>
<ul><li>You can select one or more of 
the Theiler stages to focus a search on a particular stage of embryonic development
<li>You can use terms from the Dictionary to describe source data for clones, 
probes and cDNA and genomic libraries, as well as morphological variation caused 
by mutant alleles.</ul></ul>
<br>
<h3><a href="#homology_maps/shtml">Homology Maps</a></h3>

<p>The homology maps are overviews of selected species orthology data plotted against the MGD 
consensus genetic map for the mouse. The following maps are available:
<ul>
<li><a href="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->reports/homologymap/mouse_human.shtml"> 
Whole Genome Homology Map: human on mouse background</a>
 <li><a href="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->reports/homologymap/mouse_rat.shtml">
Whole Genome Homology Map: rat on mouse background</a>
</ul>
<p>Beside each
mouse chromosome is a set of histograms, each corresponding to the human or rat chromosome.
<p>For each species, you can view a detailed homology map of each chromosome and you can  
retrieve a compact tabular listing of all the 
orthologies for that pair of chromosomes.
<!--The chromosome number is displayed immediately above
the histogram. Each bar in a histogram is positioned at the location of a nonrecombinant bin in the mouse map. The length of the bar indicates
the number of human/mouse orthologies found in that bin.
<p>The mouse chromosomes are scaled proportionally, based on 
the total cM length. Conserved regions are determined by ordering the orthologs according 
to the corresponding mouse ortholog's MGD cM position. Each unbroken run of orthologs 
 from the same chromosome is one region.
<p>Mouse chromosomes appear as vertical lines with the 
chromosome number at the top. Homologies appear as vertical 
colored bars.-->
<br>Each colored bar is a conserved region between a mouse and the selected species. 
The chromosome number for that species appears beside each bar. 
<ul>
<li>You can click on marker symbols to retrieve a detailed marker record from MGD.
<li>You can click on a contig to retrieve a detailed contig record from MGD.
<li>You can click on the chromosome numbers or the colored bars to see 
more detailed linkage maps.
</ul>
 
 
<h3><a href=#"">Mutant Allele Data</a></h3>
<p>
The MGD now accepts electronic submissions of mutant allele from the scientific community. 
Each electronic submission  will receive a permanent database accession ID.
MGD reference pages provide a link to the addociated data sets.
<ul>
<li>You can access the submission form from the
 <a href="#submissions/submissions_menu.shtml">
Data and Nomenclature Submissions</a> menu.
<li>You can find general rules for naming alleles at 
<a href="#submissions/submit.shtml">Submitting New Mutant and Allele Data</a>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#userdocs/glossary.shtml">Expanded Glossary</a></h3>
<p>We have expanded the MGI Glossary. The Glossary contains definitions for terms found
in the help documentation as well as other terms useful in understanding mouse genetics.
You will find terms defined in a general sense as they apply to eukaryotic genetics, 
particularly  mouse genetics. You will also find some terms defined as they apply to MGI
(for example, <b>gene</b>). The list of terms included in the Glossary will 
grow with each new release.
