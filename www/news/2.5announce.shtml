<H3>New MGI Vocabulary Browser</h3>

<p>The 2.5 release introduces a new  browser for viewing and querying the following vocabularies: 
<ul>
<li><a href="<!--#include file='include/go_url.html'-->">Gene Ontology (GO)</a>
<li><a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/anatdict_form.shtml">
Mouse Anatomical Dictionary</a><br>
</ul>
<p>The browser links to detail pages for each entry in a vocabulary. 
The GO terms are grouped into three 
categories to search singly or in combination: molecular function, biological process, and cellular component.
The Anatomical Dictionary links to each of the 28 Theiler stages.
The Browser query field accepts any text string and searches for all terms containing that string
and any synonyms. For example, entering "muscle" in the GO Browser and using the option to
search all categories returns 2 molecular function, 15 biological process, and 3
cellular component terms including "muscle development," 
"non-muscle myosin," and "structural protein of muscle."

<h3>Homology Maps</h3>
<p>Two new maps are available for viewing and accessing homology data. The 
maps display global views of human and rat orthology data 
plotted against the mouse genome. Beside each chromosome is a set of histograms, 
 each corresponding to a human or rat chromosome. The histogram shows 
 the density of known orthologies in a particular mouse chromosomal region. 
 From this display, you can get detailed comparative maps showing all orthologs, and you can 
 retrieve a compact tabular listing of orthologs for 
that part of a chromosome. The whole genome homology maps are:
<ul>
<li><a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->reports/homologymap/mouse_human.shtml"> 
human on mouse background</a>
<li><a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->reports/homologymap/mouse_rat.shtml">
rat on mouse background</a>
</ul>
<h3>MGI Glossary</a></dt></h3>
<p>The <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/glossary.shtml">
MGI Glossary</a> has expanded. It provides definitions of terms from our help 
documentation as well as those useful for understanding mouse genetics. 
If you find any terms that are not defined or have suggestions or requests, please
contact <a href="../support/tjl_inbox.shtml">User Support</a>. 

<H3>Mouse/Drosophila Homology Report</H3>

<P>The list of <u>similarity associations</A> between mouse and <I>Drosophila</I> genes has greatly 
expanded. There are now 3,017 associations between mouse and <I>Drosophila</I> genes.
