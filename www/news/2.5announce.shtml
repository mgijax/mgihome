<H3>New MGI Vocabulary Browser</h3>

<p>The 2.5 release introduces a new  browser for viewing and querying the following vocabularies: 
<ul>
<li><a href="<!--#include file="include/go_url.html"-->">Gene Ontology (GO)</a>
<li><a href=anatDictionary/index.shtml>Mouse Anatomical Dictionary</a><br>
</ul>
<p>The browser links to detail pages for each entry in a vocabulary. 
The GO terms are grouped into three 
categories to search singly or in combination: molecular Function, biological process and cellular component.
The Anatomy Dictionary links to each of the 28 Theiler stages.
The Browser query field accepts any text string and searches for all terms and synonyms.
An entry such as "muscle," for example, returns "muscle development," 
"non-muscle myosin," and "structural protein of muscle."

<h3>Homology Maps</h3>
<p>Two new maps are available for viewing viewing and accessing homology data. The 
maps display global views of human and rat orthology data 
plotted against the mouse genome. Beside each chromosome is a set of histograms, 
 each corresponding to a human or rat chromosome. The histogram shows 
 the density of known orthologies in a particular mouse chromosomal region. 
 You can get detailed linkage maps showing all orthologs and you can 
 retrieve a compact tablular listing of orthologs for 
that part of a chromosome. The whole genome homology maps are:
<ul>
<li><a href="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->reports/homologymap/mouse_human.shtml"> 
human on mouse background</a>
 <li><a href="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->reports/homologymap/mouse_rat.shtml">
rat on mouse background</a>
</ul>

<h3>Allele and Mutant Data<a href="../submissions/submissions_menu.shtml">
</a></h3>
<p>There is a new form available for electronic submission of allele and mutant data to MGD. 
Each submission receives a permanent database accession ID.
MGD reference pages provide a link to the associated data sets. 
P>All data sets are associated with
either an electronic submission reference or a published paper. MGD reference
pages provide links to associated data sets. <I>Mammalian Genome</I> 
publishes a list enumerating the data electronically submitted to MGD, including
accession ID, chromosome, and locus symbols as a cross-referencing service
for readers.</FONT>
Rules and guidelines for submissions are at
<a href="../submissions/submit.shtml">Submitting New Mutant and Allele Data</a>.


<h3><a href="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->userdocs/glossary.shtml">Expanded MGI Glossary</a></dt></h3>
<dd><p>The MGI Glossary has expanded. Genetic terms in the
<A HREF="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->
userdocs/helpdocs_menu.shtml">help documents</A> are linked to their 
definitions in the glossary.
