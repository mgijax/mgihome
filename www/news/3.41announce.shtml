<p>MGI is pleased to announce the following new features in its 3.41 release: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
<LI>An electronic version of <I>Origins of Inbred Mice</I> edited by Herbert C. Morse III.
This book, originally published in 1978 and long out of print, provides an historical perspective on the development of inbred mice. <!--The book's 125 figures illustrate the external, skeletal, visceral, and circulatory anatomy of the mouse. -->It is thoroughly indexed and <!--many anatomical terms in the subject index--> linked to appropriate terms at MGI. This book joins the electronic versions of three other out-of-print books, <I>The Anatomy of the Laboratory Mouse</I> by Margaret J. Cook, <I>Mouse Genetics</I> by Lee Silver and <I>The Coat Colors of Mice</I> by Willys K. Silvers. Links to all four appear on   <a href="../resources/resources.shtml">Additional MGI Tools and Links</a>. We hope that you find this book useful.  Please send questions and comments to  <A HREF="../support/tjl_inbox.shtml">User Support</A>.</li><br>

<li></li>
<br>



<LI>The remainder of the MGI 3.41 release consists of performance enhancements and bug fixes.  </LI>
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><!--In addition, a mouse SNPs query/report prototype is now available. The prototype data includes over 500,000 SNPs for 125 strains of mice mapped to Build 33 of the mouse genome sequence. The SNP data comes from the Mouse Phenome Database at The Jackson Laboratory and dbSNP at NCBI.  The <A HREF="http://proto.informatics.jax.org/snp/SNPForm.jsp">SNP Query Form</A> lets you select one or more strains and refine your searches by genome location, SNP functional class, SNP polymorphism type, and gene name. You can view query results in web format or save them as tab-delimited files.-->
