<h3><a name="34">MGI 3.44 Release</a></h3>
<p>MGI is pleased to announce its 3.44 release. The main features are:
 <ul>
   <li>A new SNP data summary. The <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/reports/snpSummary.shtml">SNP Data in MGI</a> report  contains information about the:
<UL>
<LI>dbSNP build number</li>
<li>number of submitted SNP assays (ss) loaded </li>
<li>number of reference SNPs (rs) loaded </li>
<li>average number of ss per rs</li>
<li>total number of strains with SNPs loaded</li>
<li>number of ss per submitter</LI>
<li>number of rs per strain, by chromosome.</li>
</UL><br>
<li>The Gene Expression Notebook (GEN) Version 2.2.0 release. <br>
GEN Version 2.2.0 adds Excel 2003 (running on Windows XP and Windows 2000) as a supported version of Excel. As with our previous release, this application is also stable on Excel X for Mac and Excel 2000 for PCs.</li><br>

<li>The retirement of out-of-date reports.<br>
MGI is removing the following outdated static reports from the web interface: the Mouse Locus Catalog (MLC) and the Chromosome Committee Reports. These reports have not been updated since 2000. Current data for 
<a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/searches/allele_form.shtml">phenotypes</a> and <a href="http://gbrowse.informatics.jax.org/cgi-bin/gbrowse/mouse_build_34">genome displays</a> are available in MGI.</li></ul>


<hr>
<p>MGI is the community model organism database for the laboratory mouse.
