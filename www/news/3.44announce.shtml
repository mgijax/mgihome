<h3><a name="34">MGI 3.44 release</a></h3>

<p>MGI is pleased to announce its 3.44 release. The main features are the:
 <ul>
   <li>Addition of a SNP data summary. The <b>SNP Data in MGI</b> report  contains information about the:
<UL>
<LI>dbSNP build number</li>
<li>number of submitted SNP assays (ss) loaded </li>
<li>number of reference SNPs (rs) loaded </li>
<li>average number of ss per rs</li>
<li>total number of strains with SNPs loaded</li>
<li>number of ss per submitter</LI>
<li>number of rs per strain, by chromosome.</li>
</UL>

   <li>Removal of the Mouse Locus Catalog (MLC). This descriptive phenotypic resource is replaced by annotations to structured vocabularies including the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology and the Human Disease Vocabulary.</li>
<li>Removal of access to the Chromosome Committee Reports from the Maps and Mapping Data menu. (The last year that these reports were available was 2001.)</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The remainder of the 3.44 release consists of performance enhancements, bug fixes, and updates.</p>

 

<!--<p>The Mouse SNPs Detail page provides comprehensive information about each SNP including the reference flanking sequence, assays that comprise the SNP, gene/marker associations with their corresponding function class annotations, and links to popular gene browsers including MGI Mouse Browse, with MGI-curated phenotype and allele tracks in addition to transcript and gene model tracks.</p>-->

<p>MGI is the community model organism database for the laboratory mouse.
