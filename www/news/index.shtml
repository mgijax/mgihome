<!--Newsletters from the MGSC
The production phase of the public mouse (C57BL/6J) genome sequencing effort has been underway for a year and is advancing rapidly. Francis Collins, Director of the NHGRI, distributed an open letter to the mouse community last summer to describe progress to that point. The Mouse Genome Monthly newsletter is among a number of additional means developed to keep the
community of mouse researchers abreast of the progress of the sequencing of the mouse genome. You can download the newsletter  as a pdf file below-->
