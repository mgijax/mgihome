<h4>April 4, 2007</h4>

<p>The Gene Expression Database (GXD) announces the release of GEN Version 2.3.0. This release adds Excel 2004 (running on OS X) as a supported version of Excel. As with our previous release, this application also works with Excel X for Mac and Excel 2003 and 2000 for PCs.
<p>The Gene Expression Notebook (GEN) is an electronic tool for storing and organizing expression data and images in the laboratory. Implemented in Microsoft Excel, the GEN is easy to use and customize for specific laboratory needs. It can store RNA <i>in situ</i>, immunohistochemistry, Northern, Western, and RT-PCR data as well as information on laboratory methods, reagents, and specimens. In addition, the GEN can be used to easily submit mouse data to the Gene Expression Database. Researchers interested in obtaining the GEN can download it at:<br><br> <a href="../GXD/GEN/index.shtml">Gene Expression Notebook Resource Page</a>
