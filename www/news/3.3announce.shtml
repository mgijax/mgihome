<h3><a name="33">MGI 3.3 Release Announcement</a></h3>
<P>Version 3.3 of MGI provides the scientific community with significant new information about potential mouse models of human diseases. The database contains Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) descriptions of human diseases, syndromes, and conditions, and information about genes thought to be associated with the diseases. Based on orthologies between mouse and human genes and data from researchers about mouse phenotypes resembling human diseases and the genotypes of those mice, MGI can establishes relationship between mouse and human disease phenotypes.  The new data are integrated with the rich biological knowledge represented for mouse genes and strains in MGI, allowing exploration of sequence, expression, orthology, and other related data.</P>

<P>The <a href="http://olorin.informatics.jax.org:12310/javawi2/servlet/WIFetch?page=omimVocab&subset=A">Human Disease Vocabulary Browser</a> [blah, blah, blah]
</P>
<P>The <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele_form.shtml">Phenotypes and Alleles Query Form</a> allows you great flexibility in searching for diseases and genotypes using terms from the Human Disease Vocabulary Browser (a list of disease terms) or by creating your own text phrases[& more BLAH, blah blah.]<!-- You also can focus your search on specific mutant allele parameters, such as allele or gene symbols/names, genome location, and phenotypic allele category (spontaneous, chemically induced, transgenic, gene trapped, gene targeted, and so on). &nbsp;  Additional specifications can limit your search to QTL data or to genotypes that are conditionally targeted.  You can perform complex queries, such as, "Show me all the genotypes where there is a gene-trapped allele or targeted knock-in allele on Chromosome 11 annotated to a behavioral phenotype."-->
</P>
<P>Searches produce [BLAH, blah blah.]<!--a summary table of results including mutant alleles, chromosomal location, category (spontaneous, chemically induced, transgenic, gene trapped, gene targeted, and so on), observed phenotypic classes, and genotype and strain background on which the phenotypes were observed.  You can view each record in full on the linked detail pages, which also include a description of the molecular mutation, ES cell line used (if relevant), full phenotype details,  relationship to human disease/syndromes, references, and a link to the International Mouse Strain Resource (IMSR) for available mouse strains.-->

<h3><a name="fantom3">MGI Release of FANTOM3 Data</a></h3>
<p>In collaboration with the Genome Exploration Research Group of the RIKEN Institute of Physical and Chemical Research in Japan and the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Mouse Genome Informatics has released integrated information regarding the FANTOM3 mouse cDNA clone set (see
<a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/reference.cgi?xxxxx">J:xxxxx</a>). 
The FANTOM3 set consists of xx,xxx mouse cDNA clones isolated from full-length 
enriched libraries.  This set contains xx,xxx cDNAs from the FANTOM2 effort 

(see 
<a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/reference.cgi?80961">J:80000</a>).
