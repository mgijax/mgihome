<h3><a name="33">MGI announces 3.3 release</a></h3>
<P>MGI is pleased to announce the release of Version 3.3 of the database. 
Version 3.3 integrates the data on mouse models of human disease and human disease etiology from OMIM with existing data for mouse genes and strains in MGI. This enhances the exploration of phenotypes, sequence, expression, orthology, and other related data. You can now use three of the MGI query forms 
(<a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele_form.shtml">Phenotypes and Alleles</a>,  <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker_form.shtml">Genes and Markers</a>, 
<a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/sequence_form.shtml">Mouse Sequence</a>) to search for
       <ul>
         <li>existing or potential mouse models of a particular human disease</li>
         <li>all human diseases that a particular mouse (genotype plus strain background) can be used to model.</li>
              </ul>

       </p>  
  <p>Version 3.3 also incorporates data on mouse models sought without success, as well as models free from particular confounding diseases or phenotypic traits.</p>

<p>The database now links to Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) descriptions of human diseases, syndromes, and conditions. You can use the <a href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/javawi2/servlet/WIFetch?page=omimVocab&subset=A">Human Disease Vocabulary Browser</a> to browse the complete OMIM disease vocabulary and to search by disease name, accession ID, abbreviation, or synonym.  If MGI has data associating a disease with a mouse model, that information appears in the browser and query results.</p>

<p>You can perform a query such as "Show me all the mouse models of diabetes that also exhibit insulin resistance"  by entering, for example, <i>diabetes and "insulin resistance"</i> or <i>125853 and "insulin resistance"</i> in the Phenotype/Disease box on any of the three query forms. (125853 is the OMIM accession ID for Diabetes Mellitus, Noninsulin-Dependent NIDDM.) <!--You could also enter --> The former search yields 36 alleles in 25 genes and the latter, 9 alleles in 9 genes in today's copy of the MGI database.</p>

<h3><a name="fantom3">Update to RIKEN clone data</a></h3>


<p>The latest update to clone information in the MGI database includes all 102,801 large-insert cDNA clones generated by the RIKEN group in Japan. Details appear in a manuscript published in  <i>Science</i>:

<p><b>
Carninci et al., <i>The Transcriptional Landscape of the Mammalian Genome</i>. 2005.
Science 309:1559-1563</b>

</p>
<p>You can access the RIKEN clone information in MGI  RIKEN or MGI clone identifiers, GenBank/DDBJ/EMBL accession identifiers (for the sequences associated with the clones), gene symbol or name, and MGI gene accession id.  For a tab-delimited report of the RIKEN clone sequences and their current relationships to genes in MGI, see 
<a href="ftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/reports/MGI_RIKEN.rpt">ftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/reports/MGI_RIKEN.rpt.</a>
