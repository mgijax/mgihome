<P>Version 3.0 of MGI provides the scientific community with significant new functionality with respect to the way sequence data are displayed and accessed.
</P>
<P>All mouse sequences from GenBank, RefSeq, SWISS-PROT, TrEMBL, the public mouse genome assembly, and the TIGR, DoTS, and NIA mouse gene indices are integrated with the rich biological knowledge represented for mouse genes and strains in MGI. Information about the source of the sequences, such as strain, tissue, and library (for clone sequences), has been carefully translated into controlled vocabularies to ensure accurate and complete query results.
</P>
<P>Details about sequences, such as length, type, strain, and provider descriptions, are now displayed on gene detail and sequence summary pages. Some or all of the sequences associated with a gene or marker in MGI can be downloaded directly in FASTA format or forwarded to the MouseBLAST sequence similarity server at MGI.
</P>
<P>You can now query for sequences in MGI using biological attributes of genes using the new
<a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/sequence_form.shtml">Mouse Sequence Query Form</a>. The Mouse Sequence Query Form supports such complex queries as "Show me all of the mouse RNA sequences from GenBank that are associated with genes on chromosome 9 where the genes are expressed in the embryo and are annotated to the Gene Ontology term "growth factor." This query will currently return the sequences for 4 genes (Madh3, Bmp5, Tgfbr2, and Nrg4).
</P>

<P>Sequence query results can be returned in your Web browser as a table, as a tab-delimited text file, or as a file of FASTA-formatted sequences. You can customize either the table display or the tab-delimited text output to display only selected data and to be sorted by different data types (e.g., marker name, sequence type, sequence provider, etc.).
</P>
<P>MouseBLAST output has been enhanced to allow for easy downloading of the matching sequences. In addition, the results can be resubmitted to BLAST directly from the output. From the MouseBLAST output, a report is provided that summarizes information, such as chromosome location, about the genes and markers with which the sequences are associated in MGI.
</P>
