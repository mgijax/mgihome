<h3>MGI is pleased to announce its 3.0 release.</h4>
 <P>This is a major release integrating vast amounts of sequence data with rest of the biological information already in MGI.


<P>We now maintain data on all mouse sequences from GenBank, RefSeq, Swiss-Prot,
DoTS, and the TIGR and NIA mouse gene indices. Using our curated associations
between mouse genes/markers and sequences, you can search for sequences by
all of our gene information. This includes gene nomenclature, map position, gene function (GO terms and Interpro domains), expression, and phenotypes.
</P>

<P>We also translate the source information for all the sequences to our controlled vocabularies for library name, strain, tissue, cell line, and
sex. This means that you can use the <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/searches/sequence_form.shtml">Mouse Sequence Query Form</a> to search for sequences by combining source attributes with gene information. For example, you can put <I>C57BL/6J</I> in the Strain/Species field, select <I>6</I> in the Map Position field and get back all the sequences located on chromosome 6 for every synonym of this term from all versions of GenBank.

<P>From your list of matches, you can select specific sequences and download them in tab-delimited or FASTA format. You can also can select type, length, and strain information from the Sequences section of the MGI gene detail pages and download these in FASTA format or forward them to MouseBLAST.</P>

<P>MouseBLAST query results for sequences or sequence IDs contain enhanced links to MGI mouse gene records associated with any matches. You can also see the chromosome to which the gene is mapped. And, you can now re-BLAST sequences directly from MouseBLAST output.</p>
