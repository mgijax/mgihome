<h2>MGI is pleased to announce its 3.0 release.</h2>
 <P>This is a major release integrating vast amounts of sequence data with the biological information already in MGI.</p>

<P>All mouse sequences from GenBank, RefSeq, Swiss-Prot, DoTS, and the TIGR and NIA mouse gene indices are integrated into MGI to enable powerful queries from the new <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/searches/sequence_form.shtml">Mouse Sequence Query Form</a>. You can query by 
attributes, such as length, provider, but also 
by information MGI has about the clones the sequences were derived from, 
and the genes the sequence have been associated to. </P>

<P>You can query for sequences by attributes, such as length or provider, and also 
by information MGI has about the clones the sequences were derived from, 
and the genes the sequences have been associated to.  </p>

<P>Using our curated associations between mouse genes/markers and sequences, 
you can search for sequences by information about these genes/markers.  
This includes gene/marker nomenclature, map position, gene function 
(GO annotations and InterPro domains), expression (tissue and developmental 
stage), and phenotypes of mutant alleles.</P>


<P>Source information about the clones that the sequences are derived 
from, such as strain, tissue, or library, is carefully translated into controlled vocabularies in MGI.  This enables powerful querying, since 
authors often use multiple terms to specify a strain or tissue.  </P>

<P>An example of the functionality of the new Mouse Sequence 
Query Form is to report all GenBank RNA sequences derived from 
embryos associated to genes on Chr. 9 annotated with GO terms 
containing the words <I>growth factor</I>.  This query returns four sequences 
that are associated to different genes (<I>Madh3, Bmp5, Tgfbr2,</I> and <I>Nrg4</I>).
</P>

<P>You can view the sequences returned from a query in a Web browser as a table, written to a tab-delimited text file, or in a file of FASTA-formatted sequences.  From the table, you can download selected sequences in FASTA format, or forward them to MouseBLAST. You can customize either the table display or the tab-delimited text file so that it includes only those you are most interested in.


<P>We have enhanced the MouseBLAST output so that you can easily download matching sequences in FASTA format or forward them to MouseBLAST. Information about the genes and markers that matching sequences are associated with now include the chromosome they have been mapped to. Additionally, you can now re-BLAST sequences directly from MouseBLAST output.</p>
