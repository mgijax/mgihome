  <dd>
  <li>New members of <a href="../nomen/genefamilies/index.shtml">gene families</a> are being added 
  rapidly. Mouse Genome Informatics Nomenclature Committee and HUGO are working with researchers to 
  organize and update nomenclature on important gene family groups.<br><br></dd>

  <dd>
  <li>A new <a href="../nomen/allmut_form.shtml">Allele and New Mutant Submissions Form</a> 
  is available for contributing data to MGD. Information can be submitted for new or known alleles of 
  existing genes or alleles where a phenotype has now identified a new gene. Help with nomenclature 
  is provided from linked pages. Each new allele or mutant receives a permanent database accession ID. 
  <I>Mammalian Genome</I> periodically  publishes a list enumerating the data electronically submitted 
  to MGD, including accession ID, chromosome, and locus and allele symbols as a cross-referencing 
  service for readers. For submission of other types of data to MGD, see the
   <a href="../submissions/submissions_menu.shtml">Data and Nomenclature Submissions</a> page.<br><br>

 <li><A NAME="targeted"></A>NIH Sponsors the Targeted Sequencing of Mouse BAC clones. 
 In undertaking the sequencing of the C57BL/6J mouse genome, sequencing centers are using a combined 
 strategy of whole genome shotgun sequencing and targeted BAC clone sequencing. 
 <A HREF="http://mouse.info.nih.gov">Applications</A> are being accepted by NHGRI from researchers 
 with interests in particular regions of biological significance to have BACs from those regions 
 targeted for priority sequencing!<br><br>
 <li><A NAME="locuslink"></A>MGD and NCBI Joined Forces to Develop LocusLink for Mouse. 
 MGD provides NCBI with daily updates of gene nomenclature (symbols and names), map positions, 
 and the curated data that identifies GenBank accession ids with particular genes. NCBI uses these 
 data to construct a new view of this information in the LocusLink interface and determines, for all 
 sequences available for a particular gene, which they are designating as a reference sequence.
  (Note these NCBI reference sequences may be composite sequences and are not necessarily from 
  C57BL/6J, the strain being used for the mouse genome sequencing project). LocusLink is available 
  for human, mouse, and rat, and provides links back to the primary databases from which data were 
  derived, so users can find additional information.<br><br>

  Genome Informatics web site were published in NAR's 2000 database issue.
