<h4>Human Gene Nomenclature Database: Genew3</h4>
<p>We are currently resolving issues surrounding our recent introduction of HGNC ID numbers and 
their application to withdrawn symbols.

<h4>Meetings</h4>
<p>Dr. Hester Wain spoke at the IMAGE Consortium Invitational 2000, 5th international 
coordination workshop on complete cDNA sequencing and transcriptome analysis at the Pasteur 
Institute, Paris, 10 November 2000.  Dr Wain will again be speaking at the Plant & Animal Genome IX
Conference in San Diego, California, January 13 - 17, 2001.

<p>Dr. Sue Povey attended the Gene Ontology Meeting at Banbury Center, Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory, December 10 - 12, 2000.

<h3><a name="hmg">HMG Family Nomenclature Revised</h3>
<p>December, 2000: The nomenclature for the High Mobility Group (HMG) chromosomal proteins 
is newly revised. The HMG family web page is: <a href="../nomen/genefamilies/hmgfamily.shtml">
http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen/genefamilies/hmgfamily.shtml</a>.

<h3><a name="genefamily"></a>Gene Families</h3>
<p>November, 2000: New members of gene families are being added rapidly. Mouse Genome Informatics 
Nomenclature Committee and HUGO are working with 
researchers to organize and update nomenclature on important gene family groups.
Information about these gene families in MGI is at <a href="../nomen/genefamilies/index.shtml">
Links to Nomenclature Web Resources for Gene Families.</a>

<h3><a name="allandmut">Allele and Mutant Data</a></h3>
<p><b>October, 2000</b>An <a href="../nomen/allmut_form.shtml">Allele and New Mutant Submissions Form</a> is available 
for contributing data to MGD. Information can be submitted for new or known alleles of existing genes 
or alleles where a phenotype has now identified a new gene. Help with nomenclature is provided from 
linked pages. Each new allele or mutant receives a permanent database accession ID.  
<I>Mammalian Genome</I> periodically  publishes a list enumerating the data electronically 
submitted to MGD, including accession ID, chromosome, and locus and allele symbols, as a 
cross-referencing service for readers. For submission of other types of data to MGD, see the 
 <a href="../submissions/submissions_menu.shtml">Data and Nomenclature Submissions</a> page.

<H3><A NAME="workshop"></A>Nomenclature Workshop Held in Philadelphia, PA</h3>
<p>The Human Nomenclature Committee hosted a nomenclature workshop prior to the 
Amercan Society of Human Genetics Meeting, October 2, 2000, in 
Philadelphia, PA. Representatives from the Mouse Nomenclature Committee, 
various species, sequencing centers, and databases attended. Topics discussed were: "Definition of 
Genes and Pseudogenes," "Gene Familes," and "ORFs." A detailed report of the meeting is forthcoming.

<H3><b>September, 2000</b>: <A NAME="inhibapop"></A>Nomenclature for the "Inhibitor of Apoptosis" Gene Family</H3>
<P>The Mouse and Human Nomenclature Committees have approved a new nomenclature schema for the 
inhibitor of apoptosis gene family. The list of genes belonging to the inhibitor of apoptosis gene 
family can be found by querying the marker detail box using the approved family root symbol 
'Birc', baculoviral IAP repeat-containing. Unfortunately, the stem symbol "Iap#" has already been 
approved for  the intracisternal A particles assigned in 1980, and thus could not be used for the inhibitor of 
apoptosis family. The community decided to adopt the system used for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
genes: Birc#, baculoviral IAP repeat-containing. 
<p>The reference for members of this gene family is:
