 <li><h3><a name="hgm01">HGM01-NW Gene Nomenclature Workshop Announcement</h3>
 <h4>"Looking at genes in the draft human sequence," Thursday, April 19, 2001: 09:00-12:30</h4>
 <p>This nomenclature workshop will take place in Edinburgh as a satellite meeting before HGM 2001 on the morning of April 19th, 2001.
  <h4>Introduction</h4>
   <p>Following the success of the workshop held before the 50th Annual ASHG Meeting, another small 
   meeting will be held to discuss the human genomic draft sequence and its annotation and 
   interpretation within the various online databases.  Participation will be open to all, but it is 
   requested that people send notification of their intent to attend.

    <h4>Introduction</h4>
     <p>Welcome to the first issue for 2001 of the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee's (HGNC) Nome 
     News.  Our newsletter continues to provide updates on all aspects of nomenclature.  Please feel 
     free to circulate this information and let us know your email address so that we can add you to 
     the mailing list.  This, and other Nomenclature News issues are available online at

  <p>The nomenclature for the High Mobility Group (HMG) chromosomal proteins is newly revised. The 
  HMG family web page is: <a href="../nomen/genefamilies/hmgfamily.shtml">http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen/genefamilies/hmgfamily.shtml</a>.

  <dd><li><h3><a name="genefamily"></a>Gene Families</h3>
  <p>New members of gene families are being added rapidly. The Mouse Genome Informatics Nomenclature 
  Committee and HUGO are working with researchers to organize and update nomenclature on important 
  gene family groups. Information about these gene families in MGI is at 
  <a href="../nomen/genefamilies/index.shtml">Links to Nomenclature Web Resources for Gene Families.</a>

  <p>An <a href="../nomen/allmut_form.shtml">Allele and New Mutant Submissions Form</a> is available 
  for contributing data to MGD. Information can be submitted for new or known alleles of existing 
  genes or alleles where a phenotype has now identified a new gene. Help with nomenclature is provided 
  from linked pages. Each new allele or mutant receives a permanent database accession ID.  
  <I>Mammalian Genome</I> periodically  publishes a list enumerating the data electronically 
  submitted to MGD, including accession ID, chromosome, and locus and allele symbols, as a 
  cross-referencing service for readers. For submission of other types of data to MGD, see the 
 <a href="../submissions/submissions_menu.shtml">Data and Nomenclature Submissions</a> page.

 <li><H3><A NAME="workshop"></A>Nomenclature Workshop Held in Philadelphia, PA</h3>
  <p>The Human Nomenclature Committee hosted a nomenclature workshop prior to the Amercan Society of 
  Human Genetics Meeting, October 2, 2000, in Philadelphia, PA. Representatives from the Mouse 
  Nomenclature Committee, various species, sequencing centers, and databases attended. Topics 
  discussed were: "Definition of Genes and Pseudogenes," "Gene Familes," and "ORFs." A detailed 
  report of the meeting is forthcoming.<br><br>

  <dd><li><h3><A NAME="inhibapop"></A>Nomenclature for the "Inhibitor of Apoptosis" Gene Family</H3>
  <P>The Mouse and Human Nomenclature Committees have approved a new nomenclature schema for the 
  inhibitor of apoptosis gene family. The list of genes belonging to the inhibitor of apoptosis gene 
  family can be found by querying the marker detail box using the approved family root symbol 
  'Birc', baculoviral IAP repeat-containing. Unfortunately, the stem symbol "Iap#" has already been 
  approved for  the intracisternal A particles assigned in 1980, and thus could not be used for the inhibitor of 
  apoptosis family. The community decided to adopt the system used for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
  genes: Birc#, baculoviral IAP repeat-containing. 
  <p>The reference for members of this gene family is:
