<LI>We've incorporated the Gene Ontology (GO) classifications into a new Gene Ontology Annotation Detail page. A paragraph of text about a given gene now precedes the classifications table. See <A HREF="http://shire.informatics.jax.org/wts_projects/6600/6620/GO_Final_23MAR05.HTM">GO annotations</A> for a sample description of Pax6. To access this information, enter your gene of interest on the <A HREF="www.informatics.jax.org/searches/marker_form.shtml">Genes and Markers Query Form</A>/Gene; on the Gene Detail page that appears, click an item in the Gene Ontology (GO) Classifications field.<br><br>
