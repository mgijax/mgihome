<UL>
<LI>MGI version 3.12 provides new information on Gene Ontology (GO) Annotation Detail pages.  </li><br>
<UL>
  <li>A paragraph of annotation summary text appears prior to the GO classifications. These texts are generated from structured GO annotations appearing in the table below them on these detail pages. <!--See <A HREF="http://shire.informatics.jax.org/wts_projects/6600/6620/GO_Final_23MAR05.HTM">Pax6</A> for an example.--></LI><br>
   <LI> GO terms are highlighted in the paragraph and linked to relevant MGI marker detail and reference pages as well as to databases containing additional data.</li><br>
 <LI>To access this information, enter a gene of interest in the Symbol/Name field on the 
<A HREF="http://www.informatics.jax.org/searches/marker_form.shtml">Genes and Markers Query Form</A> (use the <I>is</I> operator rather than the default, <I>begins</I>) and click <B>Search</B>. On the summary page that appears, click the gene of interest. On gene detail page, click <B>All GO Classifications</B>. The Gene Ontology Classifications page with annotation summary text about your gene appears.</li>
  </ul><br>

<LI>You can now include <I>dog</I> when performing a two-species orthology comparison using the
<A HREF="http://www.informatics.jax.org/searches/oxfordgrid_form.shtml">Oxford Grid Query Form</A>. Cells in the resulting grid represent a comparison of two chromosomes, one from each of the selected species. The grid includes links to comparative maps.</LI><br>

<LI>The remainder of the MGI 3.12 release consists of performance enhancements and bug fixes.  </LI>
