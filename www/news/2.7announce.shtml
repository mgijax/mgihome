<h2><a name="heres2.7">MGI Release 2.7 Announcement - May 4, 2001</a></h2>
<P>
<p>MGI 2.7 features enhancements to the Allele query form. 
<ul>
 <li>There is new query field for Promoter Notes. You can use this field to search for when and where a transgene is expressed. The notes appear on the Allele detail page.<!--Promoter information is crucial for annotating transgenic alleles, and it was previously embedded in the nomenclature. Promoter vocabularies are complicated and variable and have been excluded from the official nomenclature but given representation in the database.-->

<li>The Molecular Information (previously Molecular Description) section of the Allele Detail page may now include the following:
     <ul>
      <li>Mutation(s)
      <li>ES Cell Line (if applicable)
      <li>ES Cell Line Strain (if ES Cell Line appears)
      <li>Promoter
      <li>Notes (molecular)
      <li>Reference (molecular)
      </ul>
  <li>There is a new section for additional references on the Allele Detail page. The new reference is associated with a phenotypic allele used experimentally or included as a major part of a review article. The objective is to associate a particular allele with a set of publications. Previously, the page displayed three other kinds of references:
    <ul>
     <li>The Original Reference (one only) reports the creation or discovery of a spontaneous or genetically-engineered allele.<br>
     <li>The Molecular Information reference (one only) describes or identifies the molecular nature of the mutation responsible for a given phenotypic allele.
     <li>Synonym references (one per synonym) contain an allele synonym.
   </ul>
<li>Also on the Detail page is <b>Gene Expression in this Mutant</b>; beside it, the number of assays appears with a link to a display on the GXD Expression Summary page of all expression data assayed in mice carrying the allele.
<li>The Allele detail page no longer displays the Mode of Inheritance if it is not applicable.

</ul>                          
<p>Click here to see the new <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele_form.shtml">Alleles Query Form</a>; read all about the changes in the associated Help document, <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/userdocs/allele_help.shtml">Using the Alleles Query Form</a>.


<!--Probes and markers may be associated by sequence identities, hybridization, or putative relationships. We are exploring ways to make this summary more useful to you for a future release. 
 <dt><h3>Mouse/Drosophila Homologies Count</dt></h3>
 <dd>The <a href="http://prodwww/usrlocalmgi/wi/prod/www/external/ashburner/mfhomo.shtml"> Mouse/Fly Homology</a> page now displays the number of matching items at the end of the introductory material. Previously you needed to save the listing 
to a file in  order to get the count. 

 <dt><h3>Mouse Locus Catalog (MLC) Labeled as Historic Data</dt></h3>
   <dd>Information contained in the MLC records is not updated. User Support gets many calls about outdated MLC records:
 We are not actually behind in annotating these records; we are not updating them at all. We concentrate instead on new representation of alleles and phenotypes with improved annotation that is easily searched and updated. 
<br>

<dt><h3>Dates and Version Numbers Now Appear on Web Pages</dt></h3>
<dd>The Web Pages now display the database load date and the version number of the MGI release at the bottom of the page. You can find this information on the Query pages, as well as the summary and detail pages in the Web interface. You can determine at a glance if your site is using the most current data that is available.  A sample entry reads: <b><i> MGI updates data daily; data last updated at this site                                                                                             May 9, 2001</i></b>.</dd>
 
<dt><h3>Duplicate Sequence Accession IDs</h3></dt>
<dd>We updated the marker detail page to retrieve all unique J number references for a given accession ID (in the
    "other links" section). Previously, if a marker had duplicate Sequence Accession IDs associated with it (whether it was the same 
     reference or not), only one of the accession IDs appeared on the marker detail page. 

<dt><h3>Gene Synonyms Represented Differently</h3></dt>
<dd>Gene synonyms now appear on the Marker detail page in a horizontal list with entries separated by a slash. Previously, they appeared in a bulleted, vertical list. A synonym can be any former or alternative symbol or name of a marker. </dd>
