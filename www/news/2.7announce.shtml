 <dt><h3>Allele Enhancements</h3></dt>
<dd><ul><li>The Molecular Description section is now Molecular Information.
 <li>There is a section for additional references on the bottom of the Allele detail page. Previously, there were three kinds of references on the detail page:
  <ul>
 <li>Original reference (one only)- reports the creation or discoveroy of a spontaneous or genetically engineered allele
 <li>Molecular description reference - describes or identifies the molecular nature of the mutaton responsible for a given phenotypic allele
 <li>Synonym references (one per synonym)- those containing an allele synonym
 </ul>
  <p>The new fourth type of reference is associated with a phenotypic allele. The additional references are those for which an allele is used experimentally or included as a major part of a review article. The obejctive is to associate a particular allele with a set of publications. It may or may not contain information that MGD curates. 
  <li>ES Cell Lines are now represented in the database. The Strains field populates automatically with the strain listed for that ES cell line. You can use this feature to enter and display ES cell line usage in a gene targeting event and identify the genetic background of the engineered allele.
  <li> There is new Promoter Note field on the Allele Query Form. You can use this field to query by these notes and search for when and where a transgene is expressed. When present, the notes appear at the bottom of the Allele detail page.<!--Promoter information is crucial for annotating transgenic alleles, and it was previously embedded in the nomenclature. Promoter vocabularies are complicated and variable and have been excluded from the official nomenclature but given representation in the database.-->
 
<li>A new link, "Gene Expression in this mutant" takes you from the Allele detail page to the Gene Expression summary results page and a display of all expression data assayed in mice carrying the allele. From the Expression data query results page, the alleles are linked back to the Alleles Query detail page.</dd>

<li>The Allele detail page no longer displays the Mode of Inheritance if it is not applicable.
</ul>                            
<p>Click here to see the new <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele_form.shtml">Alleles Query Form</a>; read all about the changes in the associated Help document, <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/userdocs/allele_help.shtml">Using the Alleles Query Form</a>.

 <dt><h3>Mouse/Drosophila Homologies Count</dt></h3>
 <dd>The <a href="http://prodwww/usrlocalmgi/wi/prod/www/external/ashburner/mfhomo.shtml"> Mouse/Fly Homology</a> page now displays the number of matching items at the end of the introductory material. Previously you needed to save the listing 
to a file in  order to get the count. 

 <dt><h3>Mouse Locus Catalog (MLC) Labeled as Historic Data</dt></h3>
   <dd>Information contained in the MLC records is not updated. User Support gets many calls about outdated MLC records:
 We are not actually behind in annotating these records; we are not updating them at all. We concentrate instead on new representation of alleles and phenotypes with improved annotation that is easily searched and updated. 
<br>

<dt><h3>Dates and Version Numbers Now Appear on Web Pages</dt></h3>
<dd>The Web Pages now display the database load date and the version number of the MGI release at the bottom of the page. You can find this information on the Query pages, as well as the summary and detail pages in the Web interface. You can determine at a glance if your site is using the most current data that is available.  A sample entry reads: <b><i> MGI updates data daily; data last updated at this site                                                                                             May 9, 2001</i></b>.</dd>
 
<dt><h3>Duplicate Sequence Accession IDs</h3></dt>
<dd>We updated the marker detail page to retrieve all unique J number references for a given accession ID (in the
    "other links" section). Previously, if a marker had duplicate Sequence Accession IDs associated with it (whether it was the same 
     reference or not), only one of the accession IDs appeared on the marker detail page. 

<dt><h3>Gene Synonyms Represented Differently</h3></dt>
<dd>Gene synonyms now appear on the Marker detail page in a horizontal list with entries separated by a slash. Previously, they appeared in a bulleted, vertical list. A synonym can be any former or alternative symbol or name of a marker. </dd>
