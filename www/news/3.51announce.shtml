<p>For the MGI 3.1 release, mouse genome coordinates are updated to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/seq/NCBIContigInfo.html">NCBI Mouse Build 36</a> and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_summary.cgi">dbSNP Build 126</a>. Data from the manual annotation of the mouse genome is provided by  <a href="http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/Mus_musculus/index.html">Vega Mouse </a> (Vertebrate Genome Annotation of the mouse genome) at Sanger Institute; computational annotation is from <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/index.html">Ensembl</a> and  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/NCBIContigInfo.html">NCBI</a>.</p> 

<p>MGI integrates the data from VEGA, NCBI, and Ensembl into a single set of distinct genes, pseudogenes, and other genomic features to create a Unified Gene Catalog. The 3.51 release adds 6,496  additional genes (aa 5%increase) and 4,615 additional pseudogenes (a 400% increase) to MGI, and  increases the number of refSNPs (from dbSNP)  from 1.8 to 6.5 million.<p>

<p>MGI 3.51 also adds, for the first time, physical map data for microRNAs (from <a href="http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/">mirBASE</a>) as well as coordinates for QTLs. </p>

<p>Mouse GBrowse, MGI's interactive sequence map, is updated to Build 36 and now contains a microRNA track from mirBASE<!--indicating mouse genes associated with specific phenotypes--> as well as tracks for SNPs, QTLs, Ensembl genes, NCBI genes, VEGA genes, MGI representative transcripts, STS markers, phenotypes, and alleles. Access to Mouse GBrowse is from <i>www.informatics.jax.org</i> and from the sequence map section on MGI gene detail pages.</p>
  <p>dbSNP Build 126 now contains SNPs that map to the Y chromosome (dbSNP is the official source of SNP-based mouse genomic variation in MGI and serves as a central repository for single nucleotide polymorphisms &#151; SNPs &#151;, multiple nucleotide polymorphisms &#151; MNPs &#151; and short insertion/deletion polymorphisms &#151; IN-DELs).</p>

<li>The following is an example of an MGI gene detail page with a link to a curated locus report from the VEGA Gene Model: <br>

Oip5</a> (you can also try entering Vega accession ID OTTMUSG00000015949) </li><br>

<li>To see a summary of all microRNA data in MGI, set the <i>Type</i> field on the <a href="http://firien.informatics.jax.org:8080/javawi2/servlet/WIFetch?page=markerQF">Genes and Markers Query Form</a> to <i>microRNA</i>.  On the microRNA Detail page that appears, click  one of the symbol/names to find its details. The following is an example of a an MGI microRNA detail page with coordinates: <br>
<a href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/javawi2/servlet/WIFetch?page=markerDetail&key=170816"> Mirn106a</a>   </li>
