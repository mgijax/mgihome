<blockquote>
<p>MGI is pleased to announce its 3.51 release. 

<ul>
  <li>In this release, mouse genome coordinates are updated to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/seq/NCBIContigInfo.html">NCBI Mouse Build 36</a> and <a href="#dbsnp">dbSNP Build 126</a>. Data from the manual annotation of the mouse genome is provided by  <a href="http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/Mus_musculus/index.html">Vega Mouse </a> (Vertebrate Genome Annotation of the mouse genome) at Sanger Institute; computational annotation is from <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/index.html">Ensembl</a> and  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/NCBIContigInfo.html">NCBI</a>.</li><br>

<li><a name="dbsnp"></a><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_summary.cgi">dbSNP Build 126</a> now contains SNPs that map to the Y chromosome. dbSNP is the official source of SNP-based mouse genomic variation in MGI and serves as a central repository for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), multiple nucleotide polymorphisms (MNPs)m and short insertion/deletion polymorphisms (IN-DELs).</li><br>


  <li>MGI integrates the data from VEGA, NCBI, and Ensembl into a single set of distinct genes, pseudogenes, and other genomic features to create a Unified Gene Catalog. The 3.51 release adds 6,496 genes (a 5% increase), 4,615 pseudogenes (a 400% increase), and increases the number of refSNPs (from dbSNP) from 1.8 to 6.5 million.</li><br>
  <li>MGI 3.51 also adds, for the first time, physical map data for microRNAs (from <a href="http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/">mirBASE</a>) as well as coordinates for QTLs. 
Other changes to MGI data are that multiple gene models are now possible for a single MGI gene record and multiple MGI genes may be associated with a single gene model.  </li><br>
<li>Mouse GBrowse, MGI's interactive sequence map, is updated to Build 36 and now contains a microRNA track from mirBASE<!--indicating mouse genes associated with specific phenotypes--> as well as tracks for SNPs, QTLs, Ensembl genes, NCBI genes, VEGA genes, MGI representative transcripts, STS markers, phenotypes, and alleles. Access to Mouse GBrowse is from <i>www.informatics.jax.org</i> and from the sequence map section on MGI gene detail pages.</li><br>


<li>The following is an example of the MGI gene detail page for 
<a href="<!--#include file='include/java_url.html'-->WIFetch?page=markerDetail&key=54625">Oip5</a>. In the <i>Sequence Map</i> section, note the link to the VEGA ContigView</a>, and in the  representative <i>Sequences</i> section, note the VEGA Gene Model link which goes to a Vega Mouse GeneView curated locus report.  You can also find these links by entering the Vega accession ID for this gene (OTTMUSG00000015949) or the gene name (<i>Oip5</i> in the Search box on the MGI home page (http://www.informatics.jax.org/)  </li><br>

<li>To see a summary of all miRNA data in MGI, set the <i>Type</i> field on the 
<a href="<!--#include file='include/java_url.html'-->WIFetch?page=markerQF">Genes and Markers Query Form</a> to <i>microRNA</i>.  On the microRNA Detail page that appears, click  any of the symbol/names to find details. The following is an example of a an detail page with microRNA coordinates: <br>
<a href="<!--#include file='include/java_url.html'-->WIFetch?page=markerDetail&key=170816"> Mirn106a</a>   </li>
</ul>
