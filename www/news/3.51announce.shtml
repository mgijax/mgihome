<blockquote>
<p>MGI is pleased to announce its 3.51 release. 

<ul>
  <li>In this release, mouse genome coordinates are updated to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/seq/NCBIContigInfo.html">NCBI Mouse Build 36</a> and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_summary.cgi">dbSNP Build 126</a>. Computational genome annotations from Ensembl and NCBI are included in this release. New for this release is the inclusion of manually curated gene models from the VEGA (Vertebrate Genome Annotation) group from the  Sanger Institute. MGI's Mouse GBrowse has also been updated to Build 36.</li><br>



  <li>Mouse genome annotations from VEGA, NCBI, and Ensembl have been integrated into a unified catalog of mouse genome features. The 3.51 release adds 6,496 genes (a 5% increase) and 4,615 pseudogenes (a 400% increase).</li><br>

  <li>MGI 3.51 also adds, for the first time, genome coordinate data for microRNAs (from <a href="http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/">mirBASE</a>) and genome coordinates for many mouse QTL regions. </li><br>

<li>dbSNP Build 126 now contains SNPs that map to the Y chromosome. dbSNP is the official source of SNP-based mouse genomic variation in MGI and serves as a central repository for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), multiple nucleotide polymorphisms (MNPs) and short insertion/deletion polymorphisms (IN-DELs). The number of refSNPs in MGI (from dbSNP) has increased from 1.8 to 6.5 million.</li><br>


<li>To sample the new VEGA data, see the MGI gene detail page for <a href="<!--#include file='include/java_url.html'-->WIFetch?page=markerDetail&key=54625">Oip5</a>.  In the <i>Sequence Map</i> section, click the link to the VEGA ContigView.  In the <i>Sequences</i> section, click the VEGA Gene Model link to a VEGA Mouse GeneView curated locus report.  To find this (or similar) information yourself, enter a gene name on the MGI <a href="<!--#include file='include/java_url.html'-->WIFetch?page=markerQF">Genes and Markers Query Form</a>. You can also enter a gene's VEGA accession ID (for Oip5, it is OTTMUSG00000015949) or name in the Search box on the MGI home page (click <i>Accession IDs</i> for the former or <i>Gene symbols/names</i> for the latter search).</li><br>

<li>To see a summary of all miRNA data in MGI, set the <i>Type</i> field on the 
<a href="<!--#include file='include/java_url.html'-->WIFetch?page=markerQF">Genes and Markers Query Form</a> to <i>microRNA</i>.  On the microRNA Detail page that appears, click any of the symbol/names to find details. The following is an example of an MGI detail page with microRNA coordinates: 
<a href="<!--#include file='include/java_url.html'-->WIFetch?page=markerDetail&key=170816">Mirn106a</a></li>
</ul>
