<dl>
 <dt><h3>MGD Links to Locus Link and RefSeq</h3>
 <dd>With the 2.6 release, database links for DNA sequences associated with a marker include NCBI/Locus Link and 
 NCBI/RefSeq IDs in addition to DDBJ, EMBL, GSDB, GenBank, SWISS-PROT (protein database), EC (enzyme), 
 UniGene, and Interpro domain records.
<br>
 <dt><h3>Your Input Welcome Button</h3>
 <dd>A <b>Your Input Welcome</b> button is now available on the Marker Detail and the Alleles Detail 
 pages. Clicking on the button brings up a form where you can submit updates and additions to the 
 marker or allele data you are viewing. We hope this provides an easy way for you to help keep data 
 current.
<br>
 <dt><h3>SWISS-PROT Load Enhancements</a></dt></h3>
 <dd>MGI marker records are now linked to InterPro domain records. 
 <A HREF="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/">Interpro</a> - EMBL EBI (European Bioinformatics Institute) 
 in Cambridge, UK, is an integrated resource with combined information from a number of protein domain and functional 
 site sources (Pfam, PRINTS, PROSITE, ProDom) together with SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL data.   
<br>
 <dt><H3>Allele Enhancements </H3><!--TR1943-->
 <dd>The Allele summary page now includes a Molecular Notes column. This makes it easier to find the 
 allele(s) of interest because available details about an allele at a molecular level now appear on 
 this page. 
<br>
 <dt><H3>References Linked to Phenotypic Alleles</H3><!--TR2006-->
<dd>The Reference detail record contains hypertext links to data extracted from publications and 
includes such items as marker descriptions, homologies, probes, PCR primers, mapping data, and 
antibodies. With MGI Release 2.6, the links now extend to phenotypic alleles. 

 <dt><H3>Help Documentation Linked to MGI Glossary</H3>
 <dd>Terms in our help documentation are now linked to the 
 <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/glossary.shtml">MGI Glossary</a>. The 
 glossary contains terms and definitions useful for understanding mouse genetics and 
 is constantly expanding. If you have suggestions or requests for inclusion, please contact 
 <a href="../support/tjl_inbox.shtml" target=top>User Support.</a>
 
 <dt><h3>New Rules and Guidelines for Genes, Alleles, and Mutation Nomenclature</h3>
 <dd>The International Committee on Standardized Nomenclature for Mice (Ian Jackson, Chairperson) has 
 completely rewritten the Rules and Guidelines for Gene Nomenclature to explain the existing rules 
 more clearly and to detail new guidelines for naming transgenic mutations and wild-type alleles. See 
 <a href="../nomen/table.shtml">Mouse Nomenclature Rules and Guidelines</a> for the Table of Contents and 
 links to this document.
