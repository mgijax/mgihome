MGI Release 2.3.2 Announcement
</h2>
<BIG>March 16, 2000</BIG>
</CENTER>
<P>
<BIG><A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgihome_url.html'-->">New MGI Home Site</A></BIG></B><BR>
The MGI home site includes a new MGI Home Page which provides access to items that are stored at this site and not included at MGI mirror sites. The MGI Home Page enables us to promote new additions to MGI resources and services between major releases of MGI. 

<P><BIG><B>Updated <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->">MGI Main Menu</A></BIG></B><BR>
Because we have reorganized the MGI web interface somewhat, we present a revised main menu. The primary URL for MGI, http://www.informatics.jax.org, points to this main menu. You will see a similar page when you visit mirror sites.

<P><BIG><B><A HREF="whatsnew.shtml">What's New?</A></BIG></B><BR>
This page, accessible from the MGI main menu, gives a brief description of any new developments in MGI. This page is subject to change between releases so it is not a bad idea to check this page now and then.

<P><BIG><B><A HREF="../genealogy/">Genealogy Chart of Inbred Strains</A></BIG></B><BR>
The Genealogy Chart of Inbred Strains graphically depicts the origins and relationships of inbred mouse strains.  The chart is a PDF file you can download to your machine for viewing. A "Key to the Chart of Strain Genealogy" provides a list of the strains and includes, for each strain, the location coordinates on the Chart, a reference for its genealogy, and an indication whether it is extant. 

<P><BIG><B><A HREF="http://lists.informatics.jax.org/lists">Web Interface to MGI-LIST and RAT-LIST</A></BIG></B><BR>
Several months ago, we adopted the Lyris listservice to manage mgi-list and rat-list. A web interface to MGI lists is now available. You can perform any subscriber operations through this interface including read or send mail, unsubscribe, change your subscriber settings. Most importantly, the web interface provides user-friendly options for searching the list archives.

<P><BIG><B>Other Changes and Enhancements</BIG></B><BR>
<UL>
<LI><B>You are encouraged to submit your Rat symbols to MGI.</B><BR>
The <A HREF="../submissions/submissions_menu.shtml">Data and Nomenclature Submission</A> pages have been updated to support submission of rat symbols.<P>
<LI><B>Italic formatting removed from marker symbols in the web interface</B><BR>
Although nomenclature guidelines dictate that marker symbols should appear in <I>italics</I>, we have removed italics from marker symbols and some other elements in our web interface for the sake of readability. In hardcopy publications, marker symbols should still appear italicized.<P>
<LI><B><A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/menus/map_menu.shtml">Maps and Mapping Data Menu</A> provides links to RH Mapping Resources</B><BR>
These resources include the Jackson Laboratory Radiation Hybrid Database and the EBI Radiation Hybrid Database, and the Whitehead Mouse RH Database at MIT.
<P>
<LI><B>You can now search for mapping data by marker name.</B><BR>
The <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/searches/mapdata_form.shtml">Mapping Data</A> query form has a Marker Name field. You can enter some characters from a marker name and search for mapping data related to any markers that contain that string of characters in the marker name.<P>
<LI><B>Homology Information on a Reduced Number of Mammalian Species.</B><BR>
Previously, MGI contained information on over 70 mammalian species. 
However, there has been very little information available for 
most of these species. Now, MGI concentrates on the 
<A HREF="../other/species.shtml">set of mammalian species</A> of 
most interest to researchers and for which the homology data 
are growing.
<P>
<LI><B>Find out about exciting <A HREF="../other/mgi_jobs.shtml">professional opportunities</A></B><BR> in the Mouse Genome Informatics group at 
The Jackson Laboratory located in beautiful 
Bar Harbor, Maine.
