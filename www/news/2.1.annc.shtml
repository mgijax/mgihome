<CENTER><H2>Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) Release 2.1 Announcement</H2>
 <H3><EM>November 17, 1998</EM></H3></CENTER>

The MGI Web site provides integrated access to various information resources on the 
genetics and biology of the laboratory mouse, including the Mouse Genome Database (MGD), 
the Gene Expression Database (GXD) and the Encyclopedia of the Mouse Genome (Encyclopedia).


<H3>Access the <A HREF="http://tumor.informatics.jax.org/about_mtb.html">Mouse Tumor Biology Database</A></H3>
The Mouse Tumor Biology Database (MTB) prototype is a new resource accessible from the MGI
home page. (Note: <EM>MTB is stored on the MGI home site (http://www.informatics.jax.org) so that links from the mirror sites will point to this location.</EM>) MTB includes information on tumors; tumor cell
lines, pathology, incidence and latency data; genetic factors associated with tumors and tumor
development and includes links to related information in MGD and the JAX Mice database.
<P>
This version of MTB is released as a prototype, not a fully developed database product. Comments 
and suggestions from the research community are welcome!
<P> 
    
<H3>Access to Rat Data from <A HREF="http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/">MIT</A> and <A HREF="http://legba.ifrc.mcw.edu/">MCW</A></H3>
<P>
The new Rat Data pages comprise a new resource stored on the MGI home site (http://www.informatics.jax.org). Links from the mirror sites will point to this location. The new resource presents data generated in the NIH-funded <B>Rat Genome
Project</B>. These data come from two sources:
<UL>
	<LI>
	SSLP genetic mapping data generated from progeny 
	of two different intercross matings <b>(SHRSP x BN)F2</b>
	and <b>(FHH x ACI)F2</b> by Dr. Eric Lander's group at the 
	Whitehead Institute, MIT.<P>


	<LI>
	Rat polymorphism data generated by Dr. Howard Jacob's 
	group at the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW). 48 inbred 
	strains were typed for PCR product length variation 
	using the same primers used in the Whitehead/MIT SSLP 
	mapping experiments.
</UL><P>
Query forms provide access to information on rat SSLPs, polymorphisms, and genetic maps. This rat
information constitutes a data set separate from MGD. The MGI website also provides access to 
rat homology information through <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/menus/homology_menu.shtml">MGD homology queries</A> and rat strain descriptions through Michael Festing's listing
of <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/external/festing/search_form.cgi">Inbred Strains of Mice and Rats</A>
<P>
This version of the Rat Data resource is released as a prototype and is not a fully developed 
database product. Comments and suggestions from the research community are welcome!
<P>

<H3>Homology Links to Horse and Cat</H3>
MGD has included horse and cat homology information for some time. Now there are 
links from MGD homology records to <A HREF="http://www.ri.bbsrc.ac.uk/bioinformatics/databases.html">Ark-Horse</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.ri.bbsrc.ac.uk/bioinformatics/databases.html">Ark-Cat</A>, 
 databases included in ArkDB at the <A HREF="http://www.ri.bbsrc.ac.uk/">Roslin institute</A>. 

<H3>Link to FlyBase Mouse/Drosophila Homologies</H3>
The MGI <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/menus/homology_menu.shtml">Homology menu</A> now provides a link to a display of just over 1000 Mouse/Drosophila homologies. The data are from a listing maintained by Michael Ashburner 
at <u>FlyBase</u>. The report shows MGI accession ID for the 
mouse gene (linked to the gene record in MGD), mouse gene symbol, MEDLINE ID for the reference 
(linked to the MEDLINE reference), FlyBase accession ID (linked to the FlyBase record) and the
Drosophila gene symbol.

<H3>Other Enhancements</H3>
<UL TYPE=DISC>

	<LI>Updates to Michael Seldin's <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/external/seldin">DNA mapping panel data 
	set</A> ((C3H/HeJ-Fasl&lt;gld&gt; x M. spretus)F1 x C3H/HeJ-Fasl&lt;gld&gt) have been loaded into MGD.<P>
	<LI>A new <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/tools/schema/">schema browser</A> provides access to schemas on all MGI servers
	enhanced searching options.<P>
	
	<LI>Updates to Michael Festing's listing of
	 <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/external/festing/search_form.cgi">Inbred Strains of Mice and Rats</A> have been loaded into MGD.<P>
	 
	<LI>There have been minor improvements to detailed query results display for marker records and 
	gene expression records.<P>
