<CENTER><H2>Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) Release 2.0 Announcement</H2>
 <H3><EM>June 8, 1998</EM></H3></CENTER>

<EM>The MGI Web site provides integrated access to various information resources on the 
genetics and biology of the laboratory mouse, including the Mouse Genome Database (MGD), 
the Gene Expression Database (GXD) and the Encyclopedia of the Mouse Genome (Encyclopedia).
</EM>

<H3>New Gene Expression Data and Query Form Now Available</H3>
A data set of RT-PCR assays produced by Dr.Tom Freeman's laboratory 
(<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/searches/reference.cgi?46734">J:46439</A>) is 
available from the database. This data set represents the analysis of 517 genes 
in 46 mouse tissues from animals 6 to 8 weeks old. In addition, the data set includes 
studies of tissue from 15 day old mouse embryo. 

<H3><A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/searches/expression_form.shtml">Gene Expression Data Query Form</A></H3>
<UL><EM>
<LI>Where are specified genes expressed and/or at what developmental stages?<p>
<LI>What genes are expressed in specified anatomical structures and/or during 
specified developmental stages?
</EM>
</UL><BR> 
These are the basic kinds of questions you can ask using this new query form. 
You can search for expression data related to specified genes, anatomical 
structures, or developmental stages.  Query results can be returned as a listing 
of assays or assay results. See the <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/userdocs/expression_help.shtml">user documentation</A> for 
details. Initially, you can only search for RT-PCR assays. In the near 
future, more data will become available.

<H3>Revised <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/searches/linkmap_form.shtml">Linkage Maps Form</A></H3>
This form has been reorganized and simplified. You can generate a linkage map using 
information retrieved from the database. The view of the chromosome is determined by 
the criteria used to search the database. You can specify chromosome, a region of 
chromosome, include markers from selected phenotypic classes,
include DNA segments or syntenic markers, or add your own markers. You can also 
select a mammalian species for comparison to generate a  map showing homologies 
with mouse. A new option allows you to choose to display only those mouse markers 
that have homlogies in the selected species.

<H3><A HREF="<!--#include file='include/ftp_url.html'-->/pub/informatics/datasets/RI/Paigen">AXB/BXA Mapping Data Sets Available Via FTP</A></H3>
These data sets were produced by Dr. Beverly Paigen's laboratory at The Jackson Laboratory.  
In MGI 2.0, these data files are available in EXCEL format and can be downloaded from 
our ftp server.(<EM>See</EM> <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/searches/reference.cgi?46614">reference</A>). These data 
present new and revised typings in the AXB and BXA RI mapping data sets. 
This information will be incorporated into MGD's composite RI data sets for AXB and BXA and
is represented in the RI mapping experimental data records.

<H3><A HREF="../submissions/submissions_menu.shtml">Revised Data Submission Guidelines</A></H3>
The guidelines for data submissions have been updated to 
facilitate E-mail submission of MGD data. 

<H3><A HREF="http://www.informatics.jax.org/ccr">1998 Chromosome Committee Reports</A> Available On-line</H3>
The 1998 Chromosome Committee reports are complete and available on-line.<P>
