<H3><A NAME="workshop"></A>October, 2000: Nomenclature Workshop Held in Philadelphia, PA</h3>
<p>The Human Nomenclature Committee hosted a nomenclature workshop prior to the 
Amercan Society of Human Genetics Meeting, October 2, 2000, in 
Philadelphia, PA. Representatives from the Mouse Nomenclature Committee, 
various species, sequencing centers, and databases attended. Topics 
discussed were: "Definition of Genes and Pseudogenes," "Gene Familes," and
"ORFs." A detailed report of the meeting is forthcoming.

<H3><A NAME="inhibapop"></A>September, 2000:
Nomenclature for the "Inhibitor of Apoptosis" Gene Family</H3>
<P>
The Mouse and Human Nomenclature Committees have approved a new 
nomenclature schema for the inhibitor of apoptosis gene family. The list 
of genes belonging to the inhibitor of apoptosis gene family can be found 
by querying the marker detail box using the approved family root symbol 
'Birc', baculoviral IAP repeat-containing. Unfortunately, the stem symbol 
"Iap#" has already been approved for  the intracisternal A particles, 
assigned in 1980, and thus, could not be used for the inhibitor of 
apoptosis family. The community decided to adopt the system used for the 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes: Birc#, baculoviral IAP repeat-containing. 
<p>The reference for members of this gene family is:

The nomenclature for the fatty acid binding protein family has been
revised to conform with the human nomenclature and what is currently in
the literature. The root symbol for this family is Fabp# . For a complete
listing of old and new symbols, enter the symbol Fabp  or fatty acid

In undertaking the sequencing of the C57BL/6J mouse genome, sequencing centers are using a combined 
strategy of whole genome shotgun sequencing and targeted BAC clone sequencing. <A HREF="http://mouse.info.nih.gov">Applications</A> are being accepted by NHGRI from researchers with interests in particular regions of biological significance to have BACs from those regions targeted for priority sequencing!

<H3><A NAME="locuslink"></A>February, 2000: MGD and NCBI Join Forces to Develop LocusLink for Mouse</H3>
MGD provides NCBI with daily updates of gene nomenclature (symbols and names), map positions, and the curated data that identifies GenBank accession ids with particular genes. NCBI uses these data to construct a new view of this information in the LocusLink interface and determines, for all sequences available for a particular gene, which they are designating as a reference sequence. (Note these NCBI reference sequences may be composite sequences and are not necessarily from C57BL/6J, the strain being used for the mouse genome sequencing project). LocusLink is available for human, mouse, and rat, and provides links back to the primary databases from which data were derived, so users can find additional information.
