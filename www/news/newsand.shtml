<H3>March, 2000: MGD collaborates to develop Strain Genealogy Chart</H3>
A strain genealogy chart accompanies the publication:<P>

<H3><A NAME="targeted"></A>February, 2000: NIH Sponsors Targeted Sequencing of Mouse BAC clones</H3>
In undertaking the sequencing of the C57BL/6J mouse genome, sequencing centers are using a combined strategy of whole genome shotgun sequencing and targeted BAC clone sequencing. <A HREF="http://www.informatics.jax.org">Applications</A> are being accepted by NHGRI from reseachers with interests in particular regions of biological significance to have BACs from those regions targeted for priority sequencing!

<H3><A NAME="locuslink"></A>February, 2000: MGD and NCBI Join Forces to Develop LocusLink for Mouse</H3>
MGD provides NCBI with daily updates of gene nomenclature (symbols and names), map positions, and the curated data that identifies GenBank accession ids with particular genes. NCBI uses these data to construct a new view of this information in the LocusLink interface and determines, for all sequences available for a particular gene, which they are designating as a reference sequence. (Note these NCBI reference sequences may be composite sequences and are not necessarily from C57BL/6J, the strain being used for the mouse genome sequencing project). LocusLink is available for human, mouse, and rat, and provides links back to the primary databases from which data were derived, so users can find additional information.

Three articles describing resources available through the Mouse Genome Informatics web site were published in NAR's 2000 database issue.  Check them out at the <A HREF=http://www.nar.com>NAR web site</A>.
