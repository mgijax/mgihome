<P>Version 3.2 of MGI provides the scientific community with significant new functionality in the area of phenotypes, including a completely redesigned web interface for accessing and interacting with phenotypic information. Mouse phenotypic data are integrated with the rich biological knowledge represented for mouse genes and strains in MGI, allowing exploration of sequence, expression, orthology, and other related data.</P>

<P>The new <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele_form.shtml">Phenotypes and Alleles Query Form</a> allows you great flexibility in searching for phenotypes using terms from the Mammalian Phenotype (MP) Ontology (a structured vocabulary of phenotype terms) or by creating your own text phrases.  You also can focus your search on specific mutant allele parameters, such as allele or gene symbols/names, genome location, and phenotypic allele category (spontaneous, chemically induced, transgenic, gene trapped, gene targeted, and so on). &nbsp;  Additional specifications can limit your search to QTL data or to genotypes that are conditionally targeted.  You can perform complex queries, such as, " Show me all the genotypes where there is a gene-trapped allele or targeted knock-in allele on Chromosome 11 annotated to a behavioral phenotype."
</P>

<P>Searches produce a summary table of results including mutant alleles, chromosomal location, category (spontaneous, chemically induced, transgenic, gene trapped, gene targeted, and so on), observed phenotypic classes, and genotype and strain background on which the phenotypes were observed.  You can view each record in full on the linked detail pages, which also include a description of the molecular mutation, ES cell line used (if relevant), full phenotype details,  relationship to human disease/syndromes, references, and a link to the International Mouse Strain Resource (IMSR) for available mouse strains.
</P>
<P>You can also access phenotype data via the <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/MP_form.shtml">Mammalian Phenotype (MP) Ontology Browser</a>, where the terms link to all genotypes annotated either to that term or to a more specific term.  For example, the MP term <I>abnormal gastrulation</I> and its more specific terms, <I>abnormal embryo turning</I>, <I>abnormal gastrulation movements</I>, and <I>failure to gastrulate</I>, annotate 83 distinct genotypes to date. A link from the MP browser accesses a table delineating the genotype and gastrulation specific annotations; there are further links to the phenotype detail pages for all phenotypes for a given genotype.
</P>
