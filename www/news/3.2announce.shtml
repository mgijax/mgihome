<P>Version 3.2 of MGI provides the scientific community with significant new functionality with respect to the way alleles and phenotypes are displayed and accessed.
</P>
<P>All mouse phenotypic alleles from xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx are integrated with the rich biological knowledge represented for mouse genes and strains in MGI. Information about  alleles, such as xxxxxxxxxxxx), has been translated into an MP DAG vocabulary to ensure accurate and complete query results.
</P>
<P>Details about phenotypic alleles, such as xxxxx, are now displayed on phenotypic allele summary and detail pages. 
</P>
<P>You can now query for phenotypic alleles in MGI using biological attributes of genes using the new
<a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele_form.shtml">Phenotypes and Alleles Query Form</a>. The form supports such complex queries as "Show me all of the mouse phenotypic alleles that are associated with genes on chromosome 9 where the genes are expressed in the embryo and are annotated to the MP term "cardiac." This query will currently return the phenotypic alleles for x alleles and xxxx genes (xxx, xxx, xxx, xxx).
