<P>
<p>The MGI 2.8 release features:

<ul>
<li><b>Phenotype Classifications</b><br>

You can now use a vocabulary of 105 broad, high-level phenotype classification terms for searching, grouping, comparing, and analyzing phenotype data (a larger, more detailed vocabulary remains under development). These classification terms appear on the <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele_form.shtml">Alleles and Phenotypes Query Form</a>, the 
<a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker_form.shtml">Genes and Marker Query Form</a> and the 
<a href="../nomen/allmut_form.shtml">Mutant Submissions Form</a>. On each form, there is a link to the phenotype classification terms, complete with definitions and examples. You can select one or more terms from the list to search for records associated with a particular phenotype, in combination with many other parameters on the forms.  In addition, text-based searches for more specific phenotypic terms remain available.<br><br>

<li><b>Gene Ontology Searches</b>
<br>You can query GO terms by structure in MGI.  Because Gene Ontology terms are hierarchical, the search returns gene records annotated not only to terms matching your query but also genes annotated to more detailed terms related to your query -- in other words, to both terms and subterms. <br><br>
 
<li><b><a href="/silver/"><EM>Mouse&nbsp;Genetics</EM></a> Available Online</b><br>

You can now access an electronic version of Lee Silver's <EM>Mouse Genetics</EM>. This book, which has been out of print, is a valuable resource for all researchers in mouse genetics. The online version has been enhanced in the following ways:
  <ol>
  <li>All citations in the text are linked to the references. In many cases, the references in the book are linked to the reference detail page at MGI or the reference in Medline. This allows users to identify markers or clones related to that reference in MGI, or to search for more recent references using the "related articles" link in Medline.
  <li>All genes mentioned in the text are linked to the MGI marker detail page for that gene.
  <li>Clicking any table or figure cited within the text opens a new browser window displaying that table or figure.
  <li>There are many links to other documents at MGI or to other external web sites.
 </ol>
We hope that you will find this book useful.
</ul>
