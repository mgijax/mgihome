<h2><a name="heres2.8">MGI Release 2.8 Announcement - March 21, 2001</a></h2>
<P>
<p>The MGI 2.8 release features:

<ul>
<li>Phenotype Classifications
<br>We have defined a new vocabulary of approximately 120 phenotype terms. These appear on the 
<a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele_form.shtml">Alleles and Phenotypes</a> Query Form as well as on the <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker_form.shtml">Marker</a> Query Form.
 You can select terms from the multliple selection list and search for the alleles that produce a particular phenotype. <!--An allele report is also available for these searches.--><br><br>

<li><b>Gene Ontology Searches</b>
<br>You can query GO terms by structure in MGI.  Because Gene Ontology terms are hierarchical, the search returns gene records annotated not only to terms matching your query but also genes annotated to more detailed terms related your query -- in other words, both structures and substructures. <br><br>
 
<li><a href="<!--#include file='include/tutorials_url.html'-->">Tutorials</a>
<br>You can develop your expertise with the most widely used MGI Query forms and learn the various capabilities of the MGI database. The current tutorial topics are:
<ul>
<li>Finding a Gene in MGI </li>
<li>Exploring Homology</li>
<li>Gene Expression</li>
<li>Getting Around MGI</li>
</ul>
There is also a list of <a href="<!--#include file='include/tutorials_url.html'-->faq">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</a>.<br><br>
<li>Lee Silver's Mouse Genetics<br>
You can now access an electronic version of Lee Silver's 
<a href="<!--#include file='include/silverbook_url.html'-->">"Mouse Genetics."</a> This book, which has been out of print, is a valuable resource for all researchers in mouse genetics. The online version has been enhanced in the following ways:
  <ol>
  <li>All citations in the text are linked to the references. In many cases, the references in the book are linked to the reference detail page at MGI or the reference in Medline. This allows users to identify markers or clones related to that reference in MGI, or to search for more recent references using the "related articles" link in Medline.
  <li>All genes mentioned in the text are linked to the MGI marker detail page for that gene.
  <li>Clicking any table or figure cited within the text opens a new browser window displaying that table or figure.
  <li>There are many links to other documents at MGI or to other external web sites.
 </ol>
We hope that you will find this book useful.
</ul>
