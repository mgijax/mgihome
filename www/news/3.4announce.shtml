<h3><a name="34">MGI 3.4 release</a></h3>
<P>MGI is pleased to announce Version 3.4 of the database. 
<ul>
  <li>This release incorporates SNPs data from dbSNP at NCBI to include over <font size="+1" color="#FF0000">n,nnn,nnn: need number?</font> SNPs for <font size="+1" color="#FF0000">nnn:  need number?</font> strains of mice mapped to Build <font size="+1" color="#FF0000">33: which build?</font> of the mouse genome sequence.   The <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/snp_form.shtml">Mouse RefSNPs Query Form</A> lets you search for RefSNPs by strains, strain comparisons, RefSNP attributes, map position, marker range, or associated genes. </p>
<p>You can perform a query such as "Show me all refSNPs on Chromosome 1 between D1Mit30 and DMit37 that are different between  C57BL/6J and DBA/2 mice."  <font size="+1" color="#FF0000">Is there an example you prefer?</font> You can view your results in web format or save them as tab-delimited files.
</p>
  <li> The release also incorporates UniProt PIRSF protein classifications into a <a href="http://olorin.informatics.jax.org:12310/javawi2/servlet/WIFetch?page=pirsfVocab&subset=A
">Protein Superfamily Vocabulary Browser</a> for locating links between MGI mouse genes and the protein classes. You can enter, for example, <i>DNA repair</i> in the browser search box and get back a list of at least 12 superfamilies containing this term and click  your term of interest. The resulting MGI SuperFamily Protein Detail page lists all mouse superfamily members matching your query as well as any human and rat orthologs derived from MGI-curated mammalian orthology data.

<h3><a name="fantom_go"></a>FANTOM3 GO data loaded into MGI</h3>

<p>MGI recently (September 30, 2005) updated GO annotations to include all 102,801 large-insert cDNA clones generated by the RIKEN group in Japan and described in a manuscript in the journal, Science:

<blockquote>
<b>Carninci et al., <i>The Transcriptional Landscape of the Mammalian Genome.</i> 2005. Science 309:1559-1563.</b>
</blockquote>
<p>The newest set of annotations was loaded into MGI with an <i>RCA</i> evidence code, indicating a reviewed computational analysis. As part of this process, annotations assigned to genes during earlier phases of the FANTOM project were replaced with the newer annotations. Annotations retained from earlier analyses were also reassigned the RCA evidence code to  reflect the process of annotation more accurately.</p>

<p>MGI is the community model organism database for the laboratory mouse.
