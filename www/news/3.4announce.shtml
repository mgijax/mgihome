<h3><a name="34">MGI 3.4 release</a></h3>
<P>MGI is pleased to announce its 3.4 release comprised of a new Mouse SNP Query Form, a Protein Superfamily Vocabulary Browser, and Fantom GO annotation updates to RIKEN large-insert cDNA clones.

<ul>

<li><b>Mouse SNP Query Form</b></li>
<p>This release includes over 500,000 SNPs for 75 mouse strains from dbSNP build 125, mapped to Build 34 of the mouse genome sequence.   You can:
<ul>
  <li>use the new  <a href="<!--#include file='include/java_url.html'-->WIFetch?page=snpQF">Mouse SNP Query Form</a> to search dbSNP for SNPs by strains, strain comparisons, SNP attributes (variation type, functional class, accession ID), map position, marker range, or by association to MGI genes and genetic markers.</li>
  <li>search for SNPs within specified distances from a gene of interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Query results include a summary of each returned SNP, including consensus strain allele calls derived from SNP assays. You can: <ul>
 <li>choose an output strain sort order.
<li>elect to see strain allele calls marked as <i>Same</i> or <i>Different</i> relative to a reference strain. </li>
  <li>use the spreadsheet-compatible tab-limited option for graphical displays of SNP query results and for visualizing presumptive haplotype blocks. </li>
</ul>
<p>You can perform queries such as:
<ul>
  <li>Show me all SNPs on Chromosome 1 between D1Mit30 and D1Mit37 that are different between  C57BL/6J and DBA/2 mice. </li>

  <li>Return all SNPs, searching A/J, C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, C3H/HeJ, and CZECHII/EiJ, for any marker symbol/name beginning with <i>pax</i>.</li>

  <li>Compare A/HeJ, A/J, BALB/cJ, C3H/HeJ, SM/J, 129S1/SvImJ, AKR/J, DBA/2J, LP/J, NZB/BlNJ and NZW/LacJ strains with C57BL/6J, and, searching Chromosome 1, display all variation alleles with nonsynonymous substitutions.</li>
</li>
</ul><br>



<!--<p>The Mouse SNPs Detail page provides comprehensive information about each SNP including the reference flanking sequence, assays that comprise the SNP, gene/marker associations with their corresponding function class annotations, and links to popular gene browsers including MGI Mouse Browse, with MGI-curated phenotype and allele tracks in addition to transcript and gene model tracks.</p>-->



<li><b>Protein Superfamily Vocabulary Browser</b></li>

  <p> This release also incorporates UniProt PIRSF protein classifications into a 
<a href="<!--#include file='include/java_url.html'-->WIFetch?page=pirsfVocab&subset=A
">Protein Superfamily Vocabulary Browser</a> for locating links between MGI mouse genes and the protein classes. 
<ul>
  <li>You can enter, for example, <i>cadherin</i> in the browser search box and click Search.</li>
  <li>The resulting MGI Superfamily Protein Detail page lists all mouse superfamily members matching your query as well as any human and rat orthologs derived from MGI-curated mammalian orthology data. </li>
  <li>The Detail page also provides options for downloading any available sequences in FASTA format or forwarding them to MouseBLAST. </li>
    </ul><br>

<li><a name="fantom_go"></a><b>FANTOM3 GO annotation updates</b></li>

<p>MGI recently (September 30, 2005) updated GO annotations to include all 102,801 large-insert cDNA clones generated by the RIKEN group in Japan and described in the journal, Science:

<blockquote>
<b>Carninci et al., <i>The Transcriptional Landscape of the Mammalian Genome.</i> 2005. Science 309:1559-1563.</b>
</blockquote>
<p>These annotations have an <i>RCA</i> evidence code, indicating a reviewed computational analysis. As part of this process, the newer annotations replaced annotations assigned to genes during earlier phases of the FANTOM project. To reflect the process of annotation more accurately, annotations retained from earlier analyses also received the RCA evidence code.</p>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>MGI is the community model organism database for the laboratory mouse.
