<h3><a name="aboutMGD"></a>What is the Mouse Genome Database (MGD)?</h3>

<p>The Mouse Genome Database (MGD) includes information on mouse genetic
markers, molecular clones (probes, primers and YACs), phenotypes, comparative mapping data, graphical displays of linkage, cytogenetic and physical maps and experimental mapping data, as well as  strain distribution patterns for recombinant inbred strains (RIs) and cross haplotypes. Sources for information in the database include  the scientific  literature,  DNA  mapping  panel data produced by various researchers, the MIT Whitehead Institute (MIT genetic  and physical mapping data), WashU, and the Integrated Molecular Analysis of Genomes and their Expression (I.M.A.G.E.) consortium.  MGD is updated daily. Since it first became available on the Web, MGD has continued to evolve, expanding its data coverage, improving data handling, and providing new data manipulation and display tools.

<P><A NAME="mlc"></a>Phenotype records in  MGD have their origin in the
Mouse Locus Catalog (MLC), formerly an independent database. You can search for phenotype records using either the Genes and Markers query form or the Alleles and Phenotypes query form. You can search the MLC using the full-text searching capability of the Search tool, which provides very reliable query  results. An integrated OMIM/MLC query form lets you enter one search string  to  execute  a  query  in  both  MLC  and  On-line  Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), a database maintained  by  the  National  Center  for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

<P>MGD is closely linked with the Gene Expression Literature Index. The Gene Expression Literature Index is a collection  of  references  to  the  scientific literature reporting data on endogenous gene expression during mouse embryonic development. MGD provides links to Gene Expression Literature Index records through genetic marker detail records. The Gene Expression Literature Index provides links to MGD references  and  genetic  marker  records.

<H3><a name="wheredata"></a>Where does MGD data come from?</H3>
<p>MGD is updated on a daily basis by biologists on our curatorial staff who scan the current scientific  literature, extract relevant data, and enter them in MGD. Increasingly, MGD acquires data through large scale electronic transfer. Such data include mouse physical mapping  data  downloaded from MIT, data generated by the collaborative efforts of WashU, the I.M.A.G.E.  consortium and the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and by Mouse Genome Informatics. The data interface  is intended to be flexible and comprehensive so that each view of particular records in MGD provides links to any related data throughout MGD, and, where possible, to other databases on the Internet.

<h3><a name="whatdata"></a>What data does MGD contain?</h3>
<P>MGD contains the following kinds  of information:
  <UL>
  Gene, DNA marker, QTL and cytogenetic marker descriptions<BR>
  Mouse genetic phenotypes, genetic interrelationships, and polymorphic loci <BR>
  Mammalian orthology data  <BR>
  Molecular probes and clones(probes, clones, primers, and YACs)<BR>
  Genetic</A> and physical mapping data<BR>
  Polymorphic loci related to specified strains  <BR>
  Information on inbred strains (M. Festing's listing)<BR>
  References supporting  all  data  in MGD<BR>
</UL>

<h3><a name="extdb"></a>Does MGD link to any external databases?</h3>
<P>MGD  provides links  to  relevant  information  in
<a href="../other/collab_and_acknow.shtml">external databases</A> wherever possible.  Through markers, MGD links to GenBank, SWISS-PROT, EnsEMBL, InterPro, and EC. Through orthologies,  MGD links  to GDB, PigBase, SheepBase, BovMap and RATMAP. Through molecular probes and clones,  MGD links to GenBank, EMBL, and DDBJ. Through references, MGD links to PubMed.

<h3><a name="organize"></a>How is MGD organized?</h3>

<h4><A NAME="mkr"></A>Genes and Markers</h4>
<P>MGD contains information on mouse genes, DNA segments, cytogenetic markers and QTLs. Each record may include the marker symbol, name, other names or symbols and synonyms, nomenclature history, alleles, STSs, chromosomal assignment (number), centimorgan location relative to the centromere, cytogenetic band, EC number (for enzymes), phenotypic classifications, Gene Ontology (GO) terms, MGI  accession IDs and supporting references. (See <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/marker_summary.shtml">How do I interpret the summary results of my query?</A> and <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/marker_detail.shtml">How do I interpret the detail results of my query?</A> for more about marker records.)</P>

<h4><A NAME="aap"></A>Alleles and Phenotypes</h4>
<P>Information on <B>alleles</B>, formerly imbedded in phenotype  descriptions, is stored as a separate data set. More information on alleles will be available and accessible in MGD as time goes on. Links to alleles are provided in gene detail records. In
addition, there is an <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele_form.shtml">Alleles and Phenotypes Query Form</A> for  direct  queries against the allele data  set. (<I>See</I> <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/allele_help.shtml#detail">How do I interpret the detail results of my query?</A> for more about allele records).

<h4><A NAME="pro"></A>Molecular Probes and Clones</h4>
 <P>MGD contains information on probes, clones, primers, YACs, and STSs. Information may include the origin of the probe/clone, sequence, vector type, hybridizing loci, RFLPs, and references. (<EM>See</EM> the Probes Query Form,  <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/probe_help.shtml">Using the Molecular Probes and Clones Query Form</a>, <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/probe_summary.shtml">Using the Molecular Probes and Clones Summary Report</A> and <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/probe_detail.shtml">Using the Molecular Probes and Clones Detail Report</A> for more about probe/clone records.)

<P>In addition, information on genetic polymorphisms is extracted from probe/clone records in MGD. The Polymorphisms Query Form enables you to search directly  for such information and display it. (See <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/polymorphism_help.shtml#summary">How do I interpret the summary results of my query?</a> and <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/polymorphism_help.shtml#detail">How do I interpret the detail results of my query?</A> for more about polymorphism records.)

<h4><A NAME="homo"></A>Mammalian Orthology</h4>
<P>MGD contains orthology information for mouse, human and 15 other mammalian species. Most of the information for orthologies is extracted from the published scientific literature. In general, these papers explicitly report orthology relationships and MGD reflects that published information. (<EM>See</EM> <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/homology_criteria.shtml">MGD Mammalian Orthology Criteria</A> for the information used to establish orthology.) </P>

<P>An orthology record shows the symbol, species, chromosome, cM position, cytogenetic band, and accession ID for each gene in the set of orthologies. In addition, links to other mammalian databases are provided where possible. MGD orthology records may link to GDB, BovMap, PiGBASE, RATMAP, SheepBase, or ArkDB.

<P>Every orthology assertion is supported by one or more references.  The display of an orthology reference includes the J number of the reference, a short format citation, gene symbol, and species. (<EM>See</EM> <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/homology_help.shtml#detail">How do I interpret the detail results of my query?</A> for more about orthology record content in query results.)

<P>Orthology information is presented in three other formats: Oxford Grid, comparative map, and Orthology Map View. An Oxford Grid display presents an overview  of orthology between two species. Currently, this kind of comparison  is supported  for  the following species:  mouse,  human, cat, cattle, rat, pig, and sheep.</p>

 <P>The comparative map display relies on the Linkage Map application to build a graphic display of a map of a mouse chromosome (or chromosomal region)  which includes orthologies from the comparison species. See, for example, the comparative map for a 2 cM region around the mouse gene <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/accession_report.cgi?id=MGI:87895">Chrng</A> showing human orthology.</p>

<P> The Orthology Map View displays the mouse genome as the consensus genetic map, with either human or rat orthologs labeled by chromosome of origin and displayed next to the corresponding  segment  of  the  mouse  genome.  The Orthology Map View is accessible from the <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->menus/homology_menu.shtml">Orthology Menu</A> page.

<h3><A NAME="map"></A>Mapping Data</h3>
<P>MGD contains genetic mapping and linkage data, including haplotype data for linkage crosses, recombinant inbred (RI)and recombinant congenic (RD) strain distribution patterns, <I>in-situ</I> hybridization data, deletion mapping information, translocation breakpoint mapping, somatic cell hybrid concordance tables, congenic strain information, and physical mapping information. </P>

<H4><A NAME="RIdata"></A>Recombinant Inbred Strain Distribution Patterns Composite Data Set</H4>

<P>The RI Data portion of  MGD  mapping data records has been collected and organized into composite reports accessible using the Composite Recombinant Inbred Data Sets from MGD query form. The  information is displayed in tabular format with each COLUMN representing a strain  and  each ROW representing the distribution of alleles of a locus  across  these strains. </P>

<H4><A NAME="RCdata"></A>Recombinant Congenic Strain Distribution Patterns Composite Data Set</H4>
<P>Composite Recombinant Congenic Strain Distribution Patterns data can be retrieved using a new query form accessed in the "Maps and  Mapping Data" section of MGD. Information on four recombinant congenic  strain  sets  is currently available. Data include the progenitor strains for each  RCS set  and tables showing the allelic distribution for each genetic marker that has been typed in each of the recombinant  congenic strains.  Each  row  represents  the typing for a genetic marker and each column  represents  alleles  carried  by  a specific recombinant congenic strain of the RCS set. Format of the report is very similar to that of the Composite Recombinant  Inbred Strains  distribution patterns.
</P>
<p>For more information regarding the use of congenic  strains  to  analyze  traits controlled by multiple genes, see Peter Demant's paper,

Determined  by More Than One Gene, " Immunogenetics 24: 416-422, 1986.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4><A NAME="DNAdata"></A>DNA Mapping Panel Data Sets</H4>

<p>Data from the major DNA mapping panels have been downloaded into MGD and are accessible through the DNA Mapping Panel Data Sets query form and from the Linkage Map query form. The data sets include:
<ul>

</ul>

<p>DNA Mapping Panel data may appear in tabular format, where each column represents a single offspring of the cross, and each row indicates, for each locus,  which allele is present in each of the offspring. The order of rows is determined by linkage on the chromosome, and the locus nearest the centromere appears at the top of the display. Centimorgan locations for loci in the cross are determined by the provider of the cross. <P>

<H4><A NAME="mer"></a>Mapping Experiment Records</H4>
(<EM>See</EM> <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/mapping_data.shtml">Mapping Experimental Data Records</A> for information about the content of various mapping experiment records.)

<h4><A name="gmd"></a>Graphical Map Displays</h4>

<H5><A name="linkmap"></a>Linkage Maps</H5>
<p>Marker records in MGD include available information on genetic mapping locations from several sources: MGD, Chromosome Committees (up to the year 2000), and MIT. MGD provides  mapping  tools  to  generate graphic displays of genetic maps.  Using the Linkage Maps  form,  you  can  generate  a graphical map display in  Web Map  format  to display  linkage  information  for  a  chromosome  from  a  particular cross. Centimorgan locations are specific to the cross and may differ from  estimates for the same loci found in MGD marker records. You can print the display using the PostScript format option.

<H5><A name="cytomap"></a>Cytogenetic Maps</H5>
<p>MGD stores  cytogenetic  band  information  for  mouse markers. The  Cytogenetic  Maps  query  form provides  access  to map  images. Relatively few markers have been assigned cytogenetic locations.

<H5><A name="physmap"></a>Physical Maps</H5>
<p>As of June 1997, MGD stores physical  mapping  data  from MIT's mouse physical mapping project in which MIT primers and STSs are mapped against a mouse YAC library to build a contig map of  the  mouse.  MGD  provides query access to the MIT primers, STSs,  and  YACs.  In  addition,  MGD  provides integrated genetic/physical displays in Web Map format.  These  map files are updated when the MIT physical mapping data set is updated.

<h4><A NAME="ref"></A>References</h4>
MGD  contains  references  for all data in the  database.  As of November 2002,  there were nearly 75,000 references. MGD reference format is similar to that used by  PubMed.  Data  for the full MGD reference are extracted from PubMed when possible. References are first entered into MGD in an abbreviated format; these  records  are  updated when the PubMed records become available. If the  journal  is  not indexed by PubMed, our curators enter the full reference into MGD manually.  (See  the References Query Form
<a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/reference_help.shtml#detail">How do I interpret the detail results of my query?</A> for more information about reference record content in the query results.)

<h4><A NAME="ccr"></A>Chromosome Committee Reports</h4>
 The  <A  HREF="http://www.informatics.jax.org/ccr/">Chromosome Committee
Reports</A> were published annually (up to the year 2000) on the MGI web site. The  reports provide  a consensus view on linkage information for each chromosome.  These reports were also the source for cM values for markers stored in MGD. <P>
