<H2>About MGD</H2>
The Mouse Genome Database  (MGD) contains information on mouse 
genetic markers, molecular segments, phenotypes, comparative mapping 
data, experimental mapping data, and graphical displays for genetic, 
physical, and cytogenetic maps. MGD is updated daily. Since it first 
became available on the WWW, MGD has continued to evolve, expanding its data 
coverage, improving data handling, and providing several new 
data manipulation and display tools.  (<EM>See</EM>
