<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</H3>
<h4>1.  Will the information I provide be made public or will it be kept
private?</h4>
<P>We strongly urge the submission of ES knockouts and mice to the trans-NIH inventory effort prior to
publication. <U>However, the information will not be made public in any way until the submitter agrees
to the posting or the information is published.</U> If your submission is unpublished or not publicly
available we ask that you enter that information in the web page in the Status and Reference fields.
We will track those entries labeled as unpublished and not publicly available separately, and if your
ES line or Mouse fits the criteria to be included in the public MGI and NIH resources (see description
below) we will then contact you to discuss further issues about the timing of disclosure.  Please note,
however, that if your work is/was funded by the NIH it is required that these reagents be made publicly
available after publication.</P>
<p>The information provided in the inventory will be used in the early planning stages of this project
to (i) assemble an inventory of currently existing ES cells and mice containing a null mutation, (ii)
identify which of those are already publicly available or could be released to the public, as well as
the source (public repository or individual labs) from which they can be obtained, and (iii) as
necessary, facilitate the placement of these cells and mice into repositories for efficient
distribution to the research community, thereby reducing the burdens of distribution on the individual
investigators who first created them.  The compilation of information from the inventory and other
information resources will help us estimate how much additional effort will be required to establish a
comprehensive publicly available repository of ES cells.  One of the primary reasons for considering
such a repository is the expectation that it will result in a substantial savings of labor and expense
by investigators who must now expend their own resources to generate mutant ES cells and mice.<p>

<h4>2. Why have you not asked for more phenotypic information? A useful mouse is one with a phenotype. </h4>
<P>We are presently concerned with determining (i) the number of knockout alleles and the number of
individual genes that have been knocked out in the mouse genome (see program description above), and
(ii) the number of those ES cells/mice that fit our criteria for inclusion in the later stages of the
initiative (null allele expressing a reporter gene and publicly available).  Aside from the basic
phenotypic characterizations (embryonic lethal, breeds to homozygosity, etc), the measurement of many
phenotypic results vary from lab to lab. MGI is actively curating and developing its phenotypic data
resources, and should be contacted by email at 
<A HREF="mailto:mgi-help@informatics.jax.org">mgi-help@informatics.jax.org</A> or by using the submission form at <A
HREF="../nomen/allmut_form.shtml">http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen/allmut_form.shtml</A> for phenotypic data submissions.  Constructing a database of
comparative phenotypes is beyond the scope of  this phase of  the NIH project. It should be noted,
however, that as stated in the Banbury report published in Nature Genetics [Nature Genetics 36, 925-927
(2004)] the generation and maintenance of a universal phenotyping database is envisioned for a later
phase of the larger project, possibly through the expansion of the MGI resource.  The goal for the
present initiative is to make a knockout in every gene in the mouse genome.  This will include existing
KO mice that do not currently display an "interesting" phenotype.  We encourage submission of such
knockouts.</P>

<h4>3. I have funding but I have not yet successfully created the ES cell line or mouse.  Will you be
interested in receiving information about my knockout in the future?</h4>

<P>Yes, this inventory is ongoing and information will continue to be collected after the February 1,
2005, deadline posted in the initial announcement. February 1st is the date by which NIH hopes to have
completed a first pass compilation of information to be used in estimating the number the genes that
will need to be knocked out in this initiative. Future submissions are welcome and encouraged as NIH
will be able, on an on-going basis, to include those that fit the project criteria while removing them
from the list of knockout alleles that will need to be created as part of the initiative. </p>

<H4>4.  My ES line/mouse was not made in my lab and I am therefore bound by an MTA.  Is information about this ES
cell line/mouse useful to the inventory?</H4> 

<P>Yes. Please submit these data and in indicate that the
mice are NOT in a repository. In the field asking "why", please  indicate the circumstances of a
restrictive MTA.  If you have questions about an ES cell/Mouse that was acquired under  an MTA, please
contact us at <A
HREF="mailto:KOMP@mail.nih.gov">KOMP@mail.nih.gov</A> with "Mouse MTA" in the subject header.</P>

<h4>5.  Does NIH wish to include information about ES cells/mice made via other technologies such as mutants created by ENU, Transposons or Knock-ins, or mice that are NOT complete nulls but made using homologous recombination (knockout of exons, etc.)?</h4>

<P>The ultimate aim of the trans-NIH initiative is make a comprehensive catalog of knockout alleles for every
gene in the mouse genome.  Because the initiative is to produce a resource of mutant alleles leading to the complete
ablation of gene activity, we are primarily concerned with ES Cells and Mice that have been made with gene targeting
and gene trapping mechanisms, as these also allow the simultaneous insertion of a reporter gene.  However, the
determining factor is whether or not the allele is a null and contains a reporter gene, not whether it was made using
either of these two methodologies; therefore we will also include those alleles that meet these criteria but were made via other mechanisms.  On the submission page there is the opportunity to check the "other" category under "How This
Mutation was Constructed" with the possibility of entering a description of the allele.  For those that meet our
criteria but were made with alternate technologies, this function should allow accurate submission of allelic
characterization.  Please note: MGI is currently conducting a more broad inventory that includes ALL alleles,
regardless of technology, and we encourage your submission to that project at 
<A
HREF="../nomen/allmut_form.shtml">http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen/allmut_form.shtml</A>, if your reagent was generated using ENU or other mutagenesis protocols.  If your allele was made
with Transposon Mutagenesis, you can also enter this information into another ongoing inventory effort being carried
out by the Beckman Center for Transposon Research at <A
HREF="http://mouse.ccgb.umn.edu/transposon/">http://mouse.ccgb.umn.edu/transposon/</A>.</P></FONT>
