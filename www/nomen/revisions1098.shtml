<P>The International Committee for Standardised Genetic Nomenclature for
Mice meeting in Garmisch-Partenkirchen in October 1998.</P>
<B><P>Revised rules - Gene Nomenclature</P>
<P>1.3 Rules for Naming Transgenes</P>
<P>1B Insert designation </P>
</B><P>amend 3<SUP>rd</SUP> sentence to read "Italics, super- or
subscripts, internal spaces, and punctuation should not be used, except
hyphens used to separate two parts of a compound transgene as described
below".</P>
<B><P>Section a:</P>
</B><P>Delete "Hyphens are omitted when using hyphenated gene symbols" and
replace with "If the insertion is a compound construct consisting of the
promoter of one gene linked to the coding region of another, the insertion
may be designated using the symbol of the first, separated by a hyphen from
the symbol of the second. One or both symbols should be truncated if the
total number of letters exceeds six or the insert designation and the
laboratory assigned number (C. a. below) together are 11 characters or
less. Different promoter/gene constructs can be distinguished by the
different serial numbers and lab codes added as in C below". </P>
<B><P>3.3 Coisogenic, congenic and segregating inbred strains</P>
<P>2. <I>Congenic strains</P>
</B></I><P>After first sentence, delete rest of paragraph and replace with:
"They should be designated by a compound symbol consisting of three parts.
The full or abbreviated symbol of the donor strain is separated by a period
from an abbreviated symbol of the donor strain. (In cases where the donor
is not inbred or is complex, the symbol Cg can be used to denote congenic.
The use of the donor strain symbol or Cg is essential to distinguish
congenic from coisogenic strains). A hyphen then separates the strains from
the differential locus or loci introgressed from the donor strain (in
italics) <I>e.g</I>. B10.129-<I>H12<SUP>b</I></SUP> is a strain with the
genetic background og C57BL/10Sn (=B10) but which differs from that strain
by the introduction of a differential allele (<I>H12<SUP>b</I></SUP>)
derived from strain 129/J. If several lines derived from the same donor
strain are available, the individual lines may be distinguished by a number
and/or a letter in parentheses <I>e.g</I>.
B10.129(12M)-<I>H12<SUP>b</I></SUP>, B10.129(21M)-<I>H4<SUP>b</I></SUP>.
Lab codes and serial numbers may also be used (see below). When the
chromosomal segment that has been transferred is defined by several genes
or DNA loci, the segment can be defined in the symbol by listing the most
proximal and the most distal markers demonstrated to be in the segment in
parentheses, separated by a hyphen. <I>e.g</I>.
B6.Cg-<I>D4Mit25</I>-<I>D4Mit80</I> is a congenic strain made by
introducing into C57BL/6J a segment of Chromosome 4 from an outbred or
mixed strain, extending between the two defined markers.
B6.CBA-<I>D4Mit25</I>-<I>D4Mit80</I> is a similar congenic strain in which
the donor chromosomal segment comes from the CBA/J strain. Note that the
markers defining the segment only describe the most proximal and distal
markers tested, and this does not imply that there are not other untested
markers further proximal or distal. If several lines are made, in the same
or different labs, that have the same segment and would be otherwise
indistinguishable, then a serial number and lab code should be appended.
Congenic lines that differ at a histocompatibility locus and therefore
resist each other's grafts are called <I>congenic resistant</I> (CR)
lines".</P>
<P>At the end of the second paragraph add:</P>
<P>"Marker assisted breeding or marker assisted selection breeding, also
known as "speed congenics"permits the production of congenic strains
equivalent to 10 backcross generations in as few as 5 generations. (Markel
et al (1997) Nature Genetics 17. 280-284; Wakeland et al (1997) Immunology
Today 18. 472-477). Provided that the appropriate marker selection has been
used, these are termed congenic strains if the donor strain contribution
unlinked to selected locus or chromosomal region is less than 0.1% (i.e.
NE10)". </P>
