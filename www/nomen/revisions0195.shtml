Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice<BR>
<I>Chairperson: </I> Muriel T. Davisson<BR>
<P>
The revisions below have been made in the rules for symbolizing alleles
(Section 1.1.7. of the Rules and Guidelines).  Subsections 1, 3-6, 8, and 9 of
Section 1.1.7 remain the same.  The changes are effective 1 January 1995.
Changes are indicated in bold print.<P>
<P>
1.1.7.  Alleles<P>
<P>
Alleles are usually designated by the locus symbol with an added superscript
(in italics when printed).  In computerized symbols the superscript may be
denoted by prefixing an asterisk or enclosing the allele symbol in angle
brackets, <I>e.g.</I> <I>Gpi1&lt;a&gt;</I> or <I>Gpi1*a </I>or
<I>Gpi1&lt;a&gt;</I>.  Alleles for D symbol loci are described in section
1.1.3.<P>
	<B>When a spontaneous mutation is cloned or shown to occur in a previously
named candidate gene, the mutation's symbol is changed to become an allele at
the cloned locus by turning the mutation symbol into an allele symbol,
<I>e.g.</I> the <I>shi</I> (shiverer) mutation in the <I>Mbp</I> (myelin basic
protein) gene becomes <I>Mbp&lt;shi&gt;</I>.  If the original mutation
symbol already has a superscript, the mutation and allele symbols are placed on
one line in the new superscript and hyphenated, <I>e.g.</I> the
<I>shi&lt;mld&gt;</I> (myelin deficient) mutation becomes
<I>Mbp&lt;shi-mld&gt;</I> (see also #2 below).</B><P>
<P>
	2.	Recessive alleles should be indicated by the use of a lower case initial
letter for a mutant gene, <I>e.g.</I> <I>a</I>, non-agouti; <I>nu</I>, nude,
<I>gus&lt;mps&gt;</I>, mucopolysaccharidosis VII caused by a recessive
mutation in the <I>Gus</I> gene.  All other alleles, whether dominant,
codominant or having dominance relationships that vary with method of
assessment, should be indicated by the use of a capital initial letter followed
by lower case letters, as in the locus symbol, <I>e.g.</I> <I>Re</I>, rex,
<I>Ta</I>, tabby.<P>
<B>	Two exceptions to this rule are allowed for targeted and cloned mutant
genes when the original cloned gene symbol starts with an upper case
letter:</B><P>
<B>(1)   If the phenotype of mutant alleles may be recessive or codominant
depending on the method of determination, the use of upper or lower case will
depend upon what the naming investigator considers the defining phenotype.  For
example, a <u>t</u>argeted <u>m</u>utant allele of <I>Tcra</I>  created by
<u>M</u>ombaerts can be symbolized <I>Tcra&lt;tm1Mom&gt;</I>, even though
heterozygotes are not visibly different from wild type mice, if heterozygotes
can be distinguished at the DNA or protein level.</B><P>
<B>(2)  When a mutation is shown to occur in a cloned candidate gene and its
symbol is changed to become an allele of the cloned gene (see first paragraph
of 1.1.7 above), the first letter of the gene symbol may remain uppercase and
the inheritance pattern may be conveyed in the allele symbol, e.g. the <I>e</I>
(recessive yellow) and <I>E&lt;so&gt;</I> (somber) alleles at the
<I>Mc1r</I> (melanocortin 1 receptor) gene become <I>Mc1r&lt;e&gt;</I> and
<I>Mc1r&lt;E-so&gt;</I>.</B><P>
<B></B><P>
	7.	Mutations or other variations occurring in known alleles may be denoted by
a superscript <I>m</I> followed by an appropriate series symbol (as above) and
separated from the original allele symbol<B>, if one exists, </B>by a hyphen,
<I>e.g.</I> <I>Mod1&lt;a-m1Lws&gt;</I>, the first mutant allele of
<I>Mod1&lt;a&gt;</I> found by Lewis.  For known deletions of all or part of
an allele the superscript <I>m</I> may be replaced with <I>dl</I>.  Information
on the allele of origin of mutations may be valuable in elucidating changes in
DNA sequence.  <B>Mutant alleles created by targeted mutagenesis should have a
<I>t</I> preceding the <I>m</I> to denote <u>t</u>argeted, <I>e.g.</I>
<I>Cftr&lt;tm1Unc&gt;</I>, a <u>t</u>argeted <u>m</u>utation of the cystic
fibrosis transmembrane regulator gene created at the <u>U</u>niversity of
<u>N</u>orth <u>C</u>arolina.</B>
