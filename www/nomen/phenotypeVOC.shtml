<h2><center>Phenotype Classification Terms</center></h2>
<HR width="100%">
The following table lists a subset of terms from the MGI phenotype 
vocabulary and consists of the broadest, high-level terms.  These terms are 
being applied to phenotypes in the Mouse Genome Database (MGD) and are used 
to assist in searching, grouping, comparing and analyzing phenotype 
data.  These terms are also being used by a number of the Mutagenesis 
Centers.
<P>
In addition to the classification terms, the table provides examples and term definitions. A larger
more complete vocabulary is under development. We seek user input on the usefulness of these
phenotype classification terms and encourage experts, in particular systems and diseases, to
participate in developing the full hierarchy of phenotype terms.  For more information 
contact <A HREF="http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/support/tjl_inbox.shtml">User Support</A>.
