<P>These rules were most recently published in: </P>
<P>International Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice,
Chairperson: Davisson, M.T.: Rules and guidelines for genetic nomenclature
in mice. Mouse Genome 92 (1994) vii-xxxii.</P>
<P>Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice, Chairperson:
Davisson, M.T. Rules for nomenclature of inbred strains, pp. 1532-1536.
In<I>: Genetic Variants and Strains of the Laboratory Mouse</I>, Lyon,
M.F., Rastan, S., and Brown, S.D.M. (eds.), Third Edition, Volume 2, Oxford
University Press, Oxford, 1996.</P>
<P>These rules were extensively revised and adopted by the Committee in
1993. They are the most recent version of rules for nomenclature first
published the Committee in 1952 (1), and revised in 1960 (2), 1976 (3),
1981 (4), 1989 (5) and 1996 (above). Dated revisions are incorporated
whenever they are approved by the Committee. Lists of inbred strains appear
annually in <I>Mouse Genome </I>and other publications (<I>e.g.</I> 2, 6,
7, 9, 10). </P>
<P><A NAME="Inbred">3.1. Inbred strains</A> </P>
<P><A NAME="Definition">3.1.11. Definition of inbred strain</A> </P>
<P>A strain shall be regarded as inbred when it has been mated brother x
sister (hereafter called b x s) for 20 or more consecutive generations
(F20), and can be traced to a single ancestral breeding pair in the 20th or
subsequent generations. Parent x offspring matings may be substituted for b
x s matings provided that, in the case of consecutive parent x offspring
matings, the mating in each case is to the younger of the two parents. </P>
<P>Exceptionally, other breeding systems may be used, provided that the
inbreeding coefficient achieved is at least equal to that at F20 (i.e.
0.99).</P>
<P><A NAME="Symbols">3.1.2. Symbols for inbred strains</A> </P>
<P>Inbred strains shall be designated by a capital letter or letters in
roman type or, less preferably, by a combination of capital letters and
numbers, beginning with a letter. Anyone naming a new strain should consult
the most recent listing of inbred strains (published annually in <I>Mouse
Genome</I>) to avoid duplication. Brief symbols are preferred. New inbred
strain symbols should be registered as soon as possible after inbreeding is
completed. In some cases an appropriate designation may be reserved prior
to the completion of inbreeding. The contact person for strain registration
is given in current issues of <I>Mouse Genome</I>. </P>
<P>Exception to the symbol guidelines are allowed in the case of stocks
already widely used and known by designations that do not conform. For
example, see 3.1.6. </P>
<P>Any strains with a common origin separated before F20 shall be regarded
as related inbred strains and be given symbols that indicate relationship,
<I>e.g.</I> NZB, NZC, NZO. </P>
<P>Inbred targeted mutation strains derived from only two strains
(including the ES cell line as one) but not exactly RI strains may be
designated using abbreviations for the two strains separated by a comma,
<I>e.g.</I> B6,129-gene symbol.</P>
<P><A NAME="Inbreeding">3.1.3. Indication of inbreeding</A> </P>
<P>When it is desired to indicate the number of generations of b x s
inbreeding, this shall be done by appending, in parentheses, an F followed
by the number of inbred generations, <I>e.g.</I> (F87). If, because of
incomplete information, the number given represents only part of the total
inbreeding, this should be indicated by preceding it with a question mark
and plus sign, <I>e.g.</I> YBL (F?+10) means an unknown number of
generations plus 10 known. </P>
<P><A NAME="Priority">3.1.4. Priority in strain symbols</A> </P>
<P>If two inbred strains are assigned the same symbol, the symbol to be
retained shall be determined by priority in publication. For this purpose,
listing in <I>Mouse Genome</I> shall be regarded as publication.</P>
<P><A NAME="Substrains">3.1.5. Substrains</A> </P>
<P>Inbred strains may be subdivided into substrains. An established inbred
strain is considered to be divided into substrains when known or probable
genetic differences become established in separate branches. Such
differences could arise by residual heterozygosity at the time of
branching, mutation, or contamination. Hence, substrains should be
considered to be formed:</P>
<P>a) when branches are separated before F40 (i.e. after 20 to 40
generations of b x s matings). In such cases, residual heterozygosity may
be present. </P>
<P>b) when a branch is known to have been maintained separately from other
branches for 100 or more generations from their common ancestor. The
existence of differences arising by mutation is then highly probable. </P>
<P>c) when genetic differences from other branches are discovered. Such
differences could arise by any of the three means given above.
Contamination is likely to lead to numerous genetic differences, and may
thus be distinguishable from mutation. If contamination is thought likely,
the strain should be renamed; <I>e.g.</I> A2G, a strain arising by
contamination of strain A, when maintained by Glaxo (G).</P>
<P><A NAME="Designation">3.1.6. Designation of substrains</A> </P>
<P>A substrain shall be known by the name of the parent strain followed by
a slanted line and an appropriate substrain symbol. Substrain symbols may
be:</P>
<P>a) numbers, <I>e.g.</I> FL/1, FL/2; </P>
<P>b) a laboratory registration code (see 3.1.7) designating the person or
laboratory originating the strain or substrain. The initial letter of this
symbol should be a roman capital; all other letters should be lower case.
Abbreviations should be checked with published lists (in <I>Mouse
Genome</I>) to avoid duplication, <I>e.g.</I> A/He, Heston substrain of
strain A; CBA/J, Jackson Laboratory substrain of CBA; </P>
<P>c) a combination of laboratory registration code and number, beginning
with a number, when one investigator or laboratory originates more than one
substrain, <I>e.g.</I> FL/1Re, FL/4Re.</P>
<P>Exceptions are permitted for already well-known strains. For example,
lower-case letters are permitted in some strains, <I>e.g.</I> BALB/c,
C57BR/cd. In the DBA and C57BL strains, the numbers appear after the slash
as though they are substrains, but, in fact, the members of each of these
two groups of strains were separated prior to 20 generations of b x s
mating. </P>
<P>Where successive genetic differences arise in an inbred strain, leading
to successive substrain formation, the substrain symbols should be
accumulated, since the genetic differences too will be cumulative;
<I>e.g.</I> CBA/HN, a substrain of CBA found by National Institutes of
Health (N) to be genetically different from CBA/H, a substrain originated
by Harwell, from which it arose. </P>
<P><A NAME="Code">3.1.7. Laboratory Registration Code</A> </P>
<P>The characteristics of a strain may be altered by a wide range of
environmental influences such as diet, husbandry, physical environment,
microbiological flora and fauna of the mice, and the freeze-preservation of
the embryos. Viruses may be introduced or eliminated by techniques such as
cross-fostering or ovarian transplantation, and these may influence the
incidence of spontaneous diseases. As the previous history and current
environment of each colony of a strain/substrain is unique, this is
recognized by appending an appropriate laboratory registration code after
the strain/substrain symbol. Unique laboratory registration codes are
assigned by the Institute for Laboratory Animal Resources at the U.S.A.
National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C. The contact person is given in current issues of <I>Mouse Genome. </P>
</I><P><A NAME="Use">3.1.8. Use of
the Laboratory Registration Code to Designate Colony Holders</A> </P>
<P>A particular colony not known to be genetically different from the
parent colony (formerly called a subline) is now normally indicated by
appending a laboratory registration code to the end of the strain/substrain
symbol preceded by an "@" sign, <I>e.g.</I> SJL@J, the colony of strain SJL
bred <I>at</I> The Jackson Laboratory. Note that at present there are no
recognized substrains of SJL. Should another substrain be identified in the
future at a different laboratory, The Jackson Laboratory colony would then
be designated SJL/J@J, or optionally, it could be designated in this way at
any time in anticipation of the development of such substrains. Other
examples: C3H/He@N, the NIH colony of strain C3H, substrain He, bred at the
NIH; CBA/Ca-<I>se</I>@J, the Ca substrain of CBA, carrying the <I>se</I>
mutation, and bred at The Jackson Laboratory; C57BL/6J@Arc, the J substrain
of substrain 6 of C57BL bred at Arc. If the substrain symbol and laboratory
code are the same, as in SJL/J@J, for simplicity the @J may be dropped. In
all cases the laboratory code is the last symbol used, and is meant to
indicate that the environmental conditions and previous history of this
colony are unique. The @ symbol usually signifies a strain or substrain is
held in a different colony from the original but no genetic differences
from the original substrain have been identified and, therefore, it is not
considered a true substrain. (revised in 1993) </P>
<P>Note that many breeders maintain different colonies of the same strain
and substrain in different animal rooms, buildings, or even at different
sites, but only have a single laboratory registration code. It is up to the
individual organization to decide whether it would be appropriate to have a
separate laboratory registration code for each site. As far as possible, in
publications the exact origin of the animals used should be stated. Where
an organization has several laboratory registration codes (<I>e.g.</I>
there are several separate investigators at The Jackson Laboratory), each
may be used as seems most appropriate to distinguish between different
colonies. </P>
<P>One significance of manipulative processes such as fostering is that
they may add or eliminate vertically transmitted viruses. If the identity
of an added or removed virus is known, or if a virus is added artificially,
this should be indicated by appending a symbol for the virus, in capital
letters, followed by a + or - sign according to whether it is present or
absent, <I>e.g.</I> C3H/He-MTV+@N, a strain produced by inoculating
purified MTV into young hysterectomy-derived C3H/He mice bred at the NIH.
</P>
<P>Because the strain name can not hope to reflect the full previous
history of a strain, breeders are advised to keep detailed records of the
history of the strain, including details of any manipulation such as cross
fostering, freeze preservation, hysterectomy re-derivation etc. in case
such information may be relevant to the interpretation of observed results.
</P>
<P>Note that previous rules included symbols for various manipulative
procedures as part of the strain nomenclature (<I>e.g.</I> e=embryo
transfer, f=foster nursing, h=hand rearing, o=ovary transplant, p=freeze
preservation, fh=fostered on hand reared). These symbols are now
discontinued except where they form part of a well recognized strain name
(<I>e.g.</I> C3HeB/De, a substrain of C3H formed by transfer of fertilized
ova to strain C57BL). (revised 1993) </P>
<P>Laboratory registration codes should not be accumulated as environmental
factors are unlikely to act cumulatively in this sense. However, long-term
maintenance of the colony will inevitably result in the establishment of a
new substrain according to current rules (see substrains, section
3.1.5).</P>
<P><A NAME="Recombinant">3.2. Recombinant Inbred and Recombinant Congenic
strains</A> </P>
<P>1.<I> Recombinant inbred</I> (RI) strains are formed by crossing two
inbred strains, followed by 20 or more generations of b x s mating
<B>(12)</B>. The names of such strains should consist of an abbreviation of
both parental strain names separated by a capital X (the letter X) with no
intervening spaces, <I>e.g.</I> CXB, a set of recombinant inbred strains
derived from a cross of BALB/c x C57BL. </P>
<P>Different RI strains in the same series should be distinguished by
numbers (<I>e.g.</I> BXD2, BXD3, etc.) except for strains already well
known by a different designation. If the abbreviation of the male parental
strain ends in a number, a hyphen may be used to separate the series
numbers that distinguish strains, <I>e.g.</I> CXB6-2. Punctuation in strain
symbols, however, is to be avoided. </P>
<P>2. <I>Recombinant Congenic (RC) Strains</I> are formed by crossing two
inbred strains, followed by a few (usually two) backcrosses to one of the
parental strains (the "background" strain), with subsequent inbreeding
without selection for specific markers. RC Strains should be regarded as
fully inbred when the theoretical coefficient of inbreeding approximates
that of a standard inbred strain. For this purpose, one generation of
backcrossing will be regarded as being equivalent to two generations of
brother x sister mating. Thus, a strain produced by two backcrosses (N3,
equivalent to F6) followed by 14 generations of b x s mating (F14) would be
fully inbred (6). </P>
<P>RC strains are designated by an upper case abbreviation of the names of
the two parental strains (with the recipient strain given first, followed
by the donor strain) separated by a lower case "c" (<I>e.g.</I> CcS, a set
of recombinant congenic strains from a cross between BALB/c and STS,
backcrossed to BALB/c). Individual strains of the series are distinguished
by appending numbers to the strain symbols (<I>e.g.</I> CcS1). Avoid
hyphenated symbols unless the second strain ends in a number. The number of
generations of backcrossing should normally form part of the history of
each individual strain, but may be indicated in parentheses when more than
two backcross generations were used (<I>e.g.</I> CcS1(N4)). (added 1993)</P>
<P><A NAME="Coisogenic">3.3. Coisogenic, congenic, and segregating inbred
strains</A> </P>
<P>Two strains that are genetically identical (i.e. isogenic), except for a
difference at a single locus, are called <I>coisogenic</I>. True
coisogenicity can probably be achieved only by mutation within an existing
inbred strain, while lines obtained by inbreeding with forced heterozygosis
(segregating inbred), or by backcrossing to an inbred strain (congenic),
usually differ in a short chromosomal segment rather than a single gene.
</P>
<P>1. <I>Coisogenic strains</I> are formed by the occurrence of a mutation
within an inbred strain. They should be designated by the strain symbol
and, where appropriate, the substrain symbol followed by a hyphen and the
gene symbol of the differential allele (in italics in printed articles
<I>e.g.</I> DBA/Ha-<I>Myo5a<SUP>d</I>-+</SUP>). When the mutant gene is
maintained in the heterozygous condition, this should be indicated by
including a + sign in the symbol: <I>e.g.</I>
A/Fa-+/<I>Tyr<SUP>c</I></SUP>; C3H/N-+/<I>Kit<SUP>W-v</I></SUP>. Such
strains differ from the substrains described in Section 3.1.5 and 3.1.6 in
that in coisogenic strains the genetic difference is simple and precisely
defined. The number of generations of inbreeding since the mutation arose
in a coisogenic strain should be indicated by intercalating a +, or + M +
in the indication of inbreeding, <I>e.g.</I> F110 + F23 or F110 + M + F23,
23 generations of b x s matings since the occurrence of a mutation at F110
in an inbred strain.</P>
<P>2. <I>Congenic strains</I> are produced by repeated backcrosses to an
inbred strain. They should be designated by a compound symbol consisting of
three parts. The full or abbreviated symbol of the recipient strain is
separated by a period from an abbreviated symbol of the donor strain. (In
cases where the donor is not inbred or is complex, the symbol Cg can be
used to denotecongenic. The use of the donor strain symbol or Cg is
essential to distinguish congenic from coisogenic strains). A hyphen then
separates the strains from the differential locus or loci introgressed from
the donor strain (in italics) <I>e.g</I>. B10.129-<I>H12<SUP>b</I></SUP> is
a strain with the genetic background og C57BL/10Sn (=B10) but which differs
from that strain by the introduction of a differential allele
(<I>H12<SUP>b</I></SUP>) derived from strain 129/J. If several lines
derived from the same donor strain are available, the individual lines may
be distinguished by a number and/or a letter in parentheses <I>e.g</I>.
B10.129(12M)-<I>H12<SUP>b</I></SUP>, B10.129(21M)-<I>H4<SUP>b</I></SUP>.
Lab codes and serial numbers may also be used (see below). When the
chromosomal segment that has been transferred is defined by several genes
or DNA loci, the segment can be defined in the symbol by listing the most
proximal and the most distal markers demonstrated to be in the segment in
parentheses, separated by a hyphen. <I>e.g</I>.
B6.Cg-<I>D4Mit25</I>-<I>D4Mit80</I> is a congenic strain made by
introducing into C57BL/6J a segment of Chromosome 4 from an outbred or
mixed strain, extending between the two defined markers.
B6.CBA-<I>D4Mit25</I>-<I>D4Mit80</I> is a similar congenic strain in which
the donor chromosomal segment comes from the CBA/J strain. Note that the
markers defining the segment only describe the most proximal and distal
markers tested, and this does not imply that there are not other untested
markers further proximal or distal. If several lines are made, in the same
or different labs, that have the same segment and would be otherwise
indistinguishable, then a serial number and lab code should be appended.
Congenic lines that differ at a histocompatibility locus and therefore
resist each other's grafts are called <I>congenic resistant</I> (CR)
lines.</P>
<P>A strain developed by this method shall be regarded as congenic when a
minimum of 10 backcross generations to the background strain have been
made, counting the first hybrid or F1 generation as generation 1. The
number of backcross generations shall be indicated by N and the number in
parentheses. In the case in which it is necessary to use more complex
mating systems, the generations should be expressed as N equivalents (NE)
and the strain regarded as congenic at a minimum of NE10. For example, when
backcrossing a recessive gene onto an inbred background, after 10 rounds of
backcrossing and intercrossing (to recover a homozygote for the next
backcross), the strain would be at NE10. When a congenic strain is
maintained by b x s matings after backcrossing, the number of b x s
generations follows the number of backcross generations, <I>e.g.</I>
(N10F6), 10 generations of backcrossing followed by 6 generations of b x s
inbreeding; (NE12F17), a complex system of backcrosses and intercrosses
genetically equivalent to 12 backcrosses, followed by 17 generations of b x
s matings. Marker assisted breeding or marker assisted selection breeding,
also known as "speed congenics" permits the production of congenic strains
equivalent to 10 backcross generations in as few as 5 generations. (Markel
et al (1997) Nature Genetics 17. 280-284; Wakeland et al (1997) Immunology
Today 18. 472-477). Provided that the appropriate marker selection has been
used, these are termed congenic strains if the donor strain contribution
unlinked to selected locus or chromosomal region is less than 0.1% (i.e.
NE10).</P>
<P>3. <I>Segregating inbred strains</I> are developed by inbreeding with
forced heterozygosis. They shall be designated, like coisogenic strains, by
a strain symbol followed by a hyphen and the gene symbol of the segregating
locus. Indication of the segregating locus is optional when it is part of
the standard genotype of that strain, and the hyphen or entire gene symbol
may be omitted; examples are 129 or 129
<I>Tyr<SUP>c-ch</I></SUP>/<I>Tyr<SUP>c</I></SUP> (129 is customary);
WB-<I>Kit<SUP>W</I></SUP>/+ or WB. </P>
<P>The minimal inbreeding requirement for such a strain shall be the same
as that for an inbred strain, i.e. 20 generations of b x s matings. For
segregating inbred strains developed by inbreeding with forced
heterozygosis, the number of generations of such breeding may be indicated
by FH and the number in parentheses, <I>e.g.</I> (FH27), a strain developed
by 27 generations of b x s matings with forced heterozygosis. </P>
<P>4. <I>Consomic strains</I> are produced by repeated backcrossing of a
whole chromosome such as the X or Y chromosome onto an inbred strain. The
generic designation for consomic strains is HOST
STRAIN-CHROMOSOME<SUP>DONOR STRAIN</SUP>, <I>e.g.</I>
C57BL/6J-Y<SUP>AKR</SUP> is a consomic strain with the Y-chromosome of
strain AKR backcrossed onto C57BL/6J. When the chromosome comes from a
non-inbred background, an appropriate abbreviation designating the stock or
origin may be used, <I>e.g.</I> C57BL/6J-Y<SUP>DOM</SUP> has a <I>M.m.
<U>dom</U>esticus</I> Y chromosome backcrossed to C57BL/6J. In these cases,
no period followed by the donor strain is required because the strain of
origin is shown in the superscript. Capitalization of all letters in the
superscript distinguishes it from allele symbols which are lower case. As
with congenic strains, a minimum of 10 backcross generations is required,
counting the F1 generation as generation 1. (added 1990)</P>
<P>5. <I>Conplastic strains</I> are developed by backcrossing the nuclear
genome from one strain into the cytoplasm of another, i.e. the
mitochondrial parent is always the female parent during the backcrossing
program. The designation is NUCLEAR GENOME-mt<SUP>CYTOPLASMIC GENOME</SUP>,
<I>e.g.</I> C57BL/6J-<I>mt</I><SUP>BALB/c</SUP>, is a strain with the
nuclear genome of C57BL/6J, and the cytoplasmic genome of BALB/c, developed
by crossing male C57BL/6J mice with BALB/c females, followed by repeated
backcrossing of female offspring to male C57BL/6J. As with congenic
strains, a minimum of 10 backcross generations is required, counting the F1
generation as generation 1. (added 1992) </P>
<P><A NAME="Hybrids">3.4. Hybrids</A> </P>
<I><P>F1 hybrids</I> are designated by listing the female progenitor first
and the male progenitor second. The symbol can be abbreviated using
standard strain abbreviations. Thus, B6D2F1 mice are the offspring of a
C57BL/6J female mated to a DBA/2J male; D2B6F1 mice are offspring of the
reciprocal mating. The two F1 hybrids differ in the Y chromosome present in
the males, and have been exposed to a different maternal environment. They
should not be considered genetically identical. The correct full strain
symbol should be given the first time the hybrid is mentioned in a
publication; the abbreviated symbol can be used subsequently. </P>
<P>Hybrids from backcrosses and three-or four-way crosses can be designated
in the same way, that is, by giving the designation of the female parent
first and the designation of the male parent second. The hybrid parent in
such a cross is enclosed in parentheses followed by the generation number,
<I>e.g.</I> B6(D2AKRF1). The construction of these hybrids should be
described in full with complete strain designations before using the
abbreviated symbol. </P>
<P><A NAME="Stocks">3.5. Laboratory mice and Outbred stocks</A> </P>
<P>In addition, to standard inbred strains, there is a need for standard
ways to refer to laboratory mice in general and to outbred stocks. (added
1993) </P>
<P>1. <I>Laboratory mice</I>. Since laboratory strains are neither pure
<I>Mus domesticus</I> nor <I>Mus musculus</I>, they should be referred to
with the words "laboratory mice" or by the inbred strain name when
known.</P>
<P>2. <I>Non inbred stocks</I>. Outbred or random bred stocks are sometimes
given specific designations if they meet specific criteria. The criteria
and designations are defined in reference 8. Stock designations must not be
the same as those for inbred strains of the same species. New stock symbols
should be registered as for inbred strains (see 3.1.2 and 3.1.7).</P>
<P><A NAME="Lines">3.6 Advanced Intercross Lines (AIL)</A> </P>
<P>AIL are made by producing an F2 generation between two inbred strains
and then, in each subsequent generation, intercrossing mice but avoiding
sibling matings. The purpose is to increase the possibility of tightly
linked genes recombining. Symbols shall combine outbred stock and mixed
inbred strain nomenclature with the generation number included in the
symbol to distinguish these stocks from mixed inbred strains. Generations
shall be designated G3, G4, etc. beginning with the first non-sib cross
after the F2 generation. E.g. The stock Pri:B6,D2-G# is an AIL created at
<U>Pri</U>nceton from the inbred strains C57BL/6 x DBA/2. The G number
will<A NAME="References"> increase with each generation.</P>
