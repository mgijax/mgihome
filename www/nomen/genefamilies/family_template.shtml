<small>Family Note:
These genes are similar to the ADAM family, but there is no proof that the
disintegrin is functional, and therefore, the  name has been modified.</small>

<h4>Notes About Gene Family Annotations in MGD</h4> 
<h5>Nomenclature for New Genes</h5>
<p>
<small>
Contact the MGD Nomenclature Committee (<A href="mailto:nomen@informatics.jax.org">nomen@informatics.jax.org</A>)
 for approved gene symbols prior to submission.  This avoids any possible conflicts
with existing symbols and ensures that the gene symbol and name are reserved in the
MGD private nomenclature database.  All information is kept confidential until 
publication.</small>
<h5>Nomenclature for Gene Families</h5>
<p>
<small>
MGD works closely with HUGO and other interested scientists in the establishment of nomenclature 
for genes that are members of gene families and in representing the relationships between members of
 gene families. In general, a stem symbol is assigned (e.g., Entpd) and members of the family 
 are numbered (e.g., Entpd1, Entpd2, etc.). However, there are exceptions
  and many special cases.
