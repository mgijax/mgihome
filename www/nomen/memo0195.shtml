<I>	Subj.</I>:	Genes and Mutations - Symbol Changes
<P>
When spontaneous mouse mutant genes are cloned, many of them have two symbols:
one for the structural locus and one for the mutation.  The International
Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice has approved the
<A HREF="revisions0195.shtml">revision</A>
 of mutant gene symbols to show that they are mutant alleles of the
structural gene.  The simple rule is that, when a spontaneous mutation is
cloned or shown to occur in a previously named candidate gene, the mutation's
symbol is changed to become an allele at the cloned locus by turning the
mutation symbol into an allele symbol, <I>e.g.</I> the <I>shi</I> (shiverer)
mutation in the <I>Mbp</I> (myelin basic protein) gene becomes
<I>Mbp<sup>shi</sup></I>.<P>
	The symbol changes are being made now in the Mouse Genome Database (MGD), the
TJL strain registry, and the 1995-96 price list.  Attached are a 
<A HREF="symbol_changes0195.shtml">list of mutations</A> that are being changed and the 
rules governing such changes.  Note: the albino gene has been exempted from the change 
- at least for now - because of its historical significance.<P>
	If you know of other gene-mutation identities not listed or of references for
the possible identities on the last page, please provide the information with
references to Michelle Stanley-Walls (ext 6441, mls@informatics.jax.org).
