<H2>Allele and Mutant Quick Nomenclature Guide</H2>

<HR>
<H3>A note on gene and allele assignments:</H3>
<P>
A new heritable phenotypic allele may be an allele of a known gene or an allele
of a previously unknown gene.  
<UL>
<LI> if an allele of a known gene, an allele symbol and allele name will be assigned
<LI> if an allele of an unknown gene, a gene symbol and gene name will be assigned
</UL>
<B> Example:</B> You discover a new spontaneous phenotypic allele that looks 'shaker like', but with a somewhat milder phenotype.  
<UL>
<LI>Case 1, above: Upon testing, it is determined to be an allele of the Myo15 gene.
 It is assigned the allele symbol Myo15<SUP>sh2-m</SUP>, where the 'sh2-m' designates
  it as an allele and the name 'shaker 2 mild' becomes its allele name.<P>
<LI> Case 2, above: Upon testing, it is determined to be an allele of a new gene; 
it is not allelic to other alleles with similar phenotype. It is assigned a new gene symbol 'shl' and named 'shaker like'. Once this gene is cloned or functionally identified, the shl designation will become an allele designation.  
For instance, if the gene is determined to be Xyz, then this allele becomes Xyz<SUP>shl</SUP>.

<H3>Basic rules for naming alleles </H3>
<UL>
<LI>Gene and allele designations are italicized in published articles.<BR><BR>
<LI>The current list of approved <A HREF="http://www4.nas.edu/cls/afr.nsf">lab codes</A> are available from ILAR (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources).<BR><BR>
<LI>For more detail and additional special case rules, see our
<A HREF="allmut_help.shtml">Names and Symbols for Mutant Alleles</A> page.
</UL>
<BR>
For designating mutants that are alleles of <B>new</B> genes (Case 2 above), see <A HREF="checklist.shtml">guidelines for proposing a locus symbol</A>
<P>
For designating mutants that are alleles of <B>known</B> genes, the basic guidelines are:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Allele designations begin with a letter and contain alphanumeric characters. Punctuation marks occur in certain cases  where they convey meaning.<BR><BR>
<LI> Allele designations appear as superscripted short alphanumeric strings following the gene symbol of which they are an allele and serve as an acronym for the allele name. <EM> Example:</EM> Atp7a<SUP>Mo</SUP> or Egfr<SUP>tm1Cwr</SUP>.<BR><BR>
<LI>For allele designations for <B>spontaneous</B> alleles of <B>known</B> genes... <BR> 
<UL><BR>
<LI>Allele designations begin with a lower case letter if the allele is a recessive 
and begin with a capital letter otherwise.
<EM> Example:</EM> Wnt3a<SUP>vt</SUP> is the allele symbol for the <I>recessive</I> vestigal tail allele of the Wnt3a gene, while </EM> Atp7a<SUP>Mo</SUP> is the allele symbol for the <I>dominant</I> mottled allele of the Atp7a gene. <BR><BR>
<LI>If an allele is part of an allelic series, a serial number and lab code are part of its designation. Each laboratory has its own numbering series.
<EM> Example:</EM> Tyr<SUP>c-5J</SUP> is the 5th albino allele in the series discovered at The Jackson Laboratory (J) for theTyr gene.  
</UL>
<P>
<LI>Allele designations for <B>induced</B> and <B>targeted</B> alleles of <B>known</B> genes... <BR> 
<UL><BR>
<LI> Tg(YYY)#Zzz for <B>transgenic alleles</B>, where YYY is the inserted gene, 
# is the serial number, and Zzz the lab code for the laboratory. <EM>Example:</EM>The Edar<SUP>dl-Tg(Crya1)2Ove</SUP>.  The Tg(Crya1)1Ove allele of Edar is the 1st in a series made by Paul Overbeek (Ove), where Crya1 was the microinjected gene.  This transgene was found before it was associated with any known gene.  
Later, it was identified as an allele of dl (downless), and still later
 downless was cloned and identied as Edar (ectodysplasin-A receptor).<BR><BR>
<LI> tm#Zzz for <B>targeted alleles</B> by homologous recombination, where # is the serial number and Zzz the lab code for the laboratory. <EM> Example:</EM> Egfr<SUP>tm1Cwr</SUP> where this is the 1st targeted mutation of Egfr created at Case Western Reserve University (Cwr).<BR><BR>
<LI>#Zzz for<B> induced alleles</B>, where # is the serial number and Zzz the lab code for the laboratory. <EM> Example:</EM> T<SUP>39H</SUP> is the 39th mutation of T created at Harwell (H).
