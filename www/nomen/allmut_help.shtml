<H2>Names and Symbols for Mutant Alleles</H2>
<HR>
<H3> Mutant Phenotypes</H3>

<h4>Genes Known Only by Mutant Phenotype</h4>
<p>Where a gene is only known by mutant phenotype, the gene is given the name 
and symbol of the first identified mutant. 
<UL>
<LI>Symbols of mutations conferring a recessive phenotype begin with a lower 
   case letter; dominant or semidominant phenotype symbols begin with an upper 
   case letter. <EM>For example:</em>
   coloboma, <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker.cgi?1026">Cm</A>;  
   Purkinje cell degeneration, 
   <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker.cgi?12199">pcd</A>.<P>
<LI>Further (allelic) mutations at the same locus, if they have the same 
   phenotypes, are given the same name with a lab code preceded by a serial 
   number (if more than one additional allele from the same lab). In the symbol,
    the lab code is added as a superscript. <EM>For example:</EM> new alleles of
     Purkinje cell degeneration identified at The Jackson Laboratory: 
     <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele.cgi?682">pcd<SUP>2J</SUP></A>, 
     <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele.cgi?1731">pcd<SUP>3J</SUP></A>.<P>
<LI>If a new allelic mutation of a gene known only by mutant phenotype is 
    caused by a transgenic insertion, the symbol of this mutation should use 
    the symbol of the transgene (see below) as superscript. <EM>For example:</EM>
     a transgenic mutant allele of the Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) gene 
     created by Jon W. Gordon is symbolized 
     <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele.cgi?231">
     pcd<sup>Tg(Dhfr)1Jwg</sup></a>.
<P>
<LI>If the additional allele has a different phenotype, it may be given a different name, 
but when symbolized, the new mutant symbol is superscripted to the original mutant symbol. 
<EM> For example</EM>: 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele.cgi?1055">rs<SUP>grc</SUP>
</A>  is the "grey coat" allele of 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker.cgi?13248">rs</A> 
(recessive spotting).
<P>
<LI>Also, if a new mutation is described and named but not shown to be an allele of 
an existing gene until later, the original name of the new mutation can be kept even if the 
phenotype is apparently identical, but the original symbol is used, with the new mutation 
symbol as superscript. <EM> For example</EM>:  haze is an allele of ruby-eye 2 
(<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker.cgi?13281">ru2</A>), 
and hence is <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele.cgi?249">ru2<SUP>hz</SUP></A>.
<P>
<LI>A mutation caused by insertion of a transgene, but whose molecular nature is nevertheless
 unknown (i.e., it is uncloned) and which has not been shown to be an allele of an already 
 described mutant gene, should be given a  transgene symbol (see below).  When the insertion 
 site is cloned and/or molecularly characterized, the gene should be named and the transgene
  symbol becomes superscripted. <EM> For example </EM>: 
  <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker.cgi?18569">Tg(AMY1C)1Mm</a> 
  causes a mutation with a phenotype of vestibular and craniofacial abnormalities, maps to 
  Chromosome 18, but the gene in which the insertion site occurred is unknown.  Once identified,
   <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker.cgi?18569">Tg(AMY1C)1Mm</a>
    will be a superscripted allele symbol.
</UL>
<hr>
<H3> Phenotypes Due to Mutations in Structural Genes</H3>
	<p>When a spontaneous or induced mutant phenotype is subsequently found to be a mutation in a structural gene, or the gene in which the mutation has occurred is cloned, the mutation becomes an allele of that gene and the symbol for the mutant allele is formed by adding the original mutant symbol as a superscript to the new gene symbol. (The mutant symbol should retain its initial upper or lower case letter).
<EM> For example</EM>: the albino mutation of tyrosinase, <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele.cgi?50">Tyr<SUP>c</SUP></A>; the dominant white spotting mutation of Kit, <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele.cgi?363">Kit<SUP>W</SUP></A>.
<P>
If the original mutation has multiple alleles, when describing these alleles their symbols become part of the superscript to the identified structural gene
<EM> For example</EM>: viable white spotting, <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele.cgi?397">Kit<SUP>W-v</SUP></A>; sash, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele.cgi?396">Kit<SUP>W-sh</SUP></A>.
<P>
Even if the identified gene is novel we recommend that it is nevertheless given a name and symbol different from the mutant name and symbol. This will more readily allow discrimination between mutant and wild type and between gene and phenotype.<P>
<HR>
<H3>Wild Type Alleles and Revertants</H3>
<p>The wild-type allele of a any gene is indicated by +  as superscript to the the mutant symbol.
<EM> For example</EM>: the wild-type allele of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker.cgi?12179">Pax1</A> gene is
 <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele.cgi?1769">Pax1<SUP>+</SUP></A> 
 or the wild-type allele of the  
 <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker.cgi?12199">pcd</A> gene is 
 <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele.cgi?2830">pcd<sup>+</sup></a>.

<P>A revertant to wild-type of a mutant phenotype locus should be indicated by the symbol + with the 
mutant symbol as superscript. Additional revertants are given a Lab Code and preceded by a serial 
number if more than one revertant is found in a lab.  <EM> For example</EM>:  revertants to wild-type 
of the dilute mutation of myosin 5A 
(<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker.cgi?26578">Myo5a</A>) include 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele.cgi?2855">Myo5a<SUP>d+</SUP></a> and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele.cgi?2856">Myo5a<SUP>d+2J</SUP></a>.

<HR>
<H3><a name="ttm">Transgenes and Targeted Mutations</a></H3>

Any DNA that has been introduced stably into the germline of mice is a transgene. Transgenes can be broken down into two categories; 
<UL>
<LI>Those that occur by random insertion into the genome (usually by means of microinjection) and 
<LI>Those that occur as targeted events by methods involving homologous recombination.
</UL>
<h4>Transgenics as Random Insertional Events</h4>
<p>The symbol Tg will be used to designate genetically engineered transgenic events that result
 from random insertion of DNA into the genome. In most cases, the technology used to generate 
 these mice result from microinjection of the construct into the blastocyst.  The symbol 
 consists of four parts, all in Roman typeface, as follows:
 <P>Tg(YYY)#Zzz , where
<UL>
<LI>Tg indicates a transgene insertion by methods of microinjection.
<P>
<LI>(YYY) indicates the inserted sequence.  It should contain the official nomenclature for 
that gene.  In the cases where a construct was composed of roughly equal parts of two genes, 
i.e., a fusion gene, the symbols are separated by a forward slash (see examples below).  
<P>
<LI># is a number from 1 to 99,999 that is uniquely assigned to each germline transmittable 
event in a series of events generated using the same construct . 
<P>
<LI>Zzz is the Laboratory registration code.  A Laboratory Registration Code is uniquely 
assigned to each laboratory originating transgenic animals, DNA loci or inbred strains. 
Laboratories that have already been assigned such a code for other genetically defined mice 
and rats should use the same code. The registry of these codes is maintained by the Institute 
of Laboratory Animal Research (<A HREF="http://www4.nas.edu/cls/afr.nsf">ILAR</A>), 
2101 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20418.
<P>
<LI> <B>NOTE</B> : 
<UL>
<LI>Information regarding the promoter will not be reflected in the nomenclature but will be 
annotated and searchable in MGD to the fullest degree.
<LI>The strain background is independent of gene and allele nomenclature but is important in 
strain and stock designations.  Strain information will be captured in MGD associated with 
each allele.
</UL>
<P>
<LI><B>Examples</B> :
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele.cgi?2837">Tg(Wnt1)Hev</a>.
The mouse <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker.cgi?14480">Wnt1</a>
 sequence inserted into the mouse genome. This is the first such transgene reported using 
 <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker.cgi?14480">Wnt1</a> 
 by the laboratory of Harold E. Varmus (Hev).
 <p>Whether or not the transgene inserted "benignly" into the genome or whether it disrupted a
 locus is irrelevant to the nomenclature. The EXCEPTION is when the disrupted locus is identified.
 A transgene becomes an allele of that locus, as in the next example.
 <p>
<li>Tg(Hoxa1)1Chm</a>.
A construct containing the mouse homeobox a1 gene was inserted by microinjection as 
reported in a publication by Corey H. Mjaatvedt (Chm).  This is the first germline transmission
 Mjaatvedt reported using this construct.
<P>Subsequently, the locus disrupted by the transgene insertion was identified as the gene 
encoding the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 2 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker.cgi?22783">(Cspg2)</a>. 
The nomenclature now becomes 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele.cgi?1905">
Cspg2<sup>Tg(Hoxa1)Chm</sup></a>.
<p>
<LI><A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker.cgi?47895">
Tg(TCF3/HLF)1Mlc</a>. The human transcription factor 3 gene and the hepatic leukemia
 factor gene were inserted and expressed as a fusion chimeric cDNA by Michael L Cleary's 
 laboratory (Mlc).  
</UL>
</UL>
<P>
<h4>Targeted Mutagenesis</h4>
<p>The symbol tm (for targeted mutation) will be used to designate genetically engineered 
transgenic events that result from homologous recombination using embryonic stem cell 
technology.  The symbol consists of four parts, all in Roman typeface, as follows:
<P>
YYY<SUP>tm#Zzz</SUP> 
<P>YYY indicates the official gene symbol of the targeted locus.  In the cases where one gene 
is replaced by another gene (i.e., a "knock-in"), the replacing gene symbol is inserted in 
parenthesis after the # (see examples).  
<UL>
<LI>tm is used to indicate targeted mutation.
<P>
<LI># is a number from 1 to 99,999 that is uniquely assigned to each targeted mutation of a particular locus generated by that laboratory. 
<P>
<LI>Zzz  is the Laboratory registration code.  A Laboratory Registration Code is uniquely assigned to each laboratory originating transgenic animals, DNA loci or inbred strains. Laboratories that have already been assigned such a code for other genetically defined mice and rats should use the same code.  The registry of these codes is maintained by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Research 
(<A HREF="http://www4.nas.edu/cls/afr.nsf">ILAR</A>), 2101 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC
20418.
<P>
<LI><B>NOTE: </B>
<UL>
<LI>Information regarding the construct and replacement cassette is not reflected in the 
nomenclature but will be annotated and searchable in MGD to the fullest degree.
<LI>The strain background is independent of the nomenclature. 
</UL>
<P>
<B>Examples</B>: 
<UL>	
<LI><A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele.cgi?2175">Bmp1<SUP>tm1Blh</SUP></A>
 is a targeted mutation  generated at the bone morphogenetic protein 1 
 (<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker.cgi?595">Bmp1</A>) 
 locus in the laboratory of Brigid L. Hogan (Blh).   
<P>
<LI><A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele.cgi?2829">En1<SUP>tm1(Otx2)Wrst</sup></a>, 
 where the <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker.cgi?12112">Otx2</A> gene was knocked into the <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker.cgi?8510">En1</A>
  locus as reported in the originating publication from the laboratory of W. Wurst (Wrst). Note 
  that this nomenclature form is only used when one gene is replacing another. 
<P>
Often the E.coli beta-galactosidase gene or the Cre recombinase gene are "knocked-in" to a 
locus. The same symbol convention is used for these.  
<P>
<LI><A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele.cgi?2491">
Tfam<SUP>tm1Lrsn</SUP></A> and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele.cgi?2488">Tfam<SUP>tm1.1Lrsn</SUP></A> 
are the types of designations used when one targeting vector is used to generate multiple 
germline transmissible alleles, such as with Cre-Lox system for recombination.  Here 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele.cgi?2491">Tfam<SUP>tm1Lrsn</SUP></A> 
is used to designate a Lox P insertion and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele.cgi?2488">Tfam<SUP>tm1.1Lrsn</SUP></A> 
is used to designate the allele generated after mating with a Cre transgenic mouse.
<P>NOTE: The designation of tm1.1 is only utilized when the presence of CRE generates a germ line
 transmissible event.  For example,  disruption of 
 <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker.cgi?29142">
 Tfam</a> by Cre-Lox recombination using a 
 ubiquitously expressed beta-actin Cre transgene produces a mouse where the disruption of 
 <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker.cgi?29142">Tfam</A> 
 is heritable.  However, in cases where the presence of Cre-Lox produces a somatic 
 event, no nomenclature is assigned.  For example, when 
 <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker.cgi?29142">Tfam</a>
  is selectively 
 disrupted in heart and skeletal muscle using a muscle creatine kinase promoter. 
 This promoter is active from embryonic day 13.  In these cases, it is best to represent the 
 mouse as a product of its genotype: 
 <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele.cgi?2491">
 Tfam<SUP>tm1Lrsn</SUP></A>/<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele.cgi?2491">
 Tfam<SUP>tm1Lrsn</SUP></A> ; +/Ckme-cre 
</UL>
</UL>
<h4>Gene Trap Loci and Alleles</h4>
<P>Gene trap experiments in embryonic stem (ES) cells produce cell lines in which integration 
into a putative gene is selected by virtue of its expression in ES cells. The trapped gene is 
usually (although not necessarily) mutated by the integration. The loci of integration of a 
series of gene trap lines, once characterized as unique, can be named and symbolized as members of 
a series, with an appropriate root. The symbol consists of four parts, all in Roman typeface, 
as follows:
<P>Gt(YYY)#Zzz
<UL>
<LI>Gt is used to indicate a gene trap insertion.
<P>
<LI>(YYY) indicates the inserted vector sequence. 
<P>
<LI># is a number from 1 to 99,999 that is uniquely assigned to each germline transmittable 
event in a series of events generated using the same construct.
<P>
<LI>Zzz is the Laboratory registration code.  A Laboratory Registration Code is uniquely 
assigned to each laboratory originating transgenic animals, DNA loci, or inbred strains. 
Laboratories that have already been assigned such a code for other genetically defined mice 
and rats should use the same code. The registry of these codes is maintained by the Institute 
of Laboratory Animal Research (<A HREF="http://www4.nas.edu/cls/afr.nsf">ILAR</A>), 
2101 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20418.
<P>
<B>Example</B>: 
<ul>	
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/marker.cgi?37270">Gt(ROSA)26Sor</A> 
   is a gene "trapped" by the ROSA vector. It is the 26th germline transmissible event using the 
   ROSA vector from the laboratory of Phillipe Soriano.
 <p>  
   As with transgenes identified only through an insertion, gene trap integrations will become 
   alleles of the gene, once that gene is identified.
