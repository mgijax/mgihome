<H3>8 Basic rules for naming mouse loci</H3>
<P>
<H4>Mouse locus symbols...</H4>
<OL>
<LI>are short, 3-4 characters recommended as acronym for the locus name, but not to exceed 10 characters.
<P>
<LI>begin with a letter and contain only alphanumeric characters.
<P>
<LI>are similar for members of a gene family, use a common stem followed by 1-2 alphanumerics.
<P>
<LI>contain no punctuation; hyphens are permitted when they separate two adjacent numbers (<I>e.g.</I> <I>Lamb1-2</I>).
<P>
<LI>do contain hyphens in related sequence and pseudogene symbols (<I>e.g.</I> <I>Adh5-ps1</I>).
<P>
<LI>begin with a lower case letter if the locus is a newly discovered recessive mutation (<I>e.g.</I> <I>wi</I>); in all other cases, they begin with a capital letter.
<P>
<LI>anonymous DNA loci follow the convention D#XXX%e  where # = chromosome location; XXX = lab code and % = serial number in series.  A trailing "e" is added only when the DNA segment is known to be expressed.  The current list of approved <A HREF="http://www4.nas.edu/cls/afr.nsf">lab codes</A> are available from ILAR (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, Washington, D.C.)
<P>
<LI>are italicized in published articles
</OL>

<HR>
<H3>Checklist for Proposing a Locus Symbol</H3>
<OL>
<LI>Determine that the phenotype is genetic:
<UL>
<LI>Inherited in a Mendelian fashion
<LI>Cloned locus sequence
</UL>
<P>
<LI>Search <A HREF="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->searches/marker_form.shtml">MGD</A> and <A HREF="http://gdbwww.gdb.org/">GDB</A> to ensure the entry does not already exist. 
<P>
<LI>Refer to the <A HREF="table.shtml">Mouse Nomenclature Rules and Guidelines</A> to formulate possible combinations of letters for the symbol.
<P>
<LI>Check <A HREF="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->searches/marker_form.shtml">MGD</A> and <A HREF="http://gdbwww.gdb.org/">GDB</A> to see which combinations from (3) are available.
<P>
<LI>Check ordered <I>lists</I> of mouse and human symbols to ensure that the proposed new symbol will not  interrupt an existing &quot;family&quot; of locus symbols.
<P>
<LI>Check that the proposed symbol is not in common use in other contexts such as mouse and human locus mapping literature:
<UL>
<LI>Searches of <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/">Entrez</A>, <A HREF="http://www.expasy.ch/cgi-bin/sprot-search-ful">SwissProt</A> or Medline can help to identify such problems
</UL>
<P>
<LI>Check similar entries in <A HREF="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->searches/marker_form.shtml">MGD</A> and <A HREF="http://gdbwww.gdb.org/">GDB</A> to ensure that the proposed symbol is constructed in the same manner as related symbols..
