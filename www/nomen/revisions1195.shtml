<H2><CENTER>Nomenclature Rules Revisions - November 1995<BR></CENTER></H2>

<H4>The International Committee for Standardized Genetic Nomenclature
for Mice passed the nomenclature revisions below at its annual
meeting, 12 November 1995, Michigan. The most recent publication
of the nomenclature rules was in <I>Mouse Genome</I> 1994; 92(2):vii-xxxii.
Revisions to existing rules are in boldface; paragraphs with no
boldface text represent additions to the rules.<BR>
</H4>
<H4><U>Gene nomenclature<BR></U></H4>
<P>
<U>Add to 1.1.2</U>
<P>
8. Symbols for quantitative trait loci (QTL) genes shall follow
the rules for other types of genes (see 1.1.1). They should be
symbolized with 3-4 character symbols that are acronyms of the
name and begin with a capital letter. Those affecting the same
complex trait, i.e. in a series like <I>Idd</I> loci, shall be
given the same stem symbol and serially numbered. &quot;q&quot;
may be used as the final letter preceding the serial number but
is not required.<BR>
<P>
9. Expressed sequence tagged (EST) loci shall be given the symbol
ESTM###, where M identifies mouse as opposed to human EST loci.and
### = a serial number assigned from the Mouse Genome Database
(MGD).<BR>
<P>
10. Genes encoded by the opposite (anti-sense) strand of a known
gene shall be given their own symbols.<BR>
<P>
11. Alternate transcripts from the same gene should not be given
different &quot;locus&quot; symbols.<BR>
<P>
<U>Revise 1.1.3. Genes and loci recognized by DNA sequence</U>
<P>
........
<P>
2. Intragenic loci may be given D symbols to distinguish individual
sites within a gene. Remember that genes are functional units
whereas loci can be any distinct DNA segment, and that several
variant D-loci may lie within, and be used to assay, a gene. Variation
in DNA sequence of a known gene or tightly linked sequences should
be described using the gene symbol and current rules for nomenclature
of genes and alleles. Intragenic D-locus symbols should only be
used (a) when describing intragenic mapping analysis or (b) when
stating that a gene was typed using an intragenic D-locus (see
next paragraph for the most common example of this). <B>NOTE:
While D symbols could be given to all variants within a gene,
the Committee discourages the use of D symbols for intragenic
DNA segments except when a D locus symbol is needed to relate
a segment to other objects within or near the gene. YAC ends may
be given D symbols when they are used for genetic mapping. <BR>
</B>
<P>
<U>Add to 1.1.3 just before section on <I>Chromosomal regions
detected cytologically and by RFLPs</I></U>
<P>
Alternate or new loci detected with primers for a known locus
belong to the lab discovering them and shall be symbolized by
that lab with its lab code and next serial number on the chromosome.
&quot;Mismapped&quot; loci should only be resymbolized if it can
be proved that the original locus does not exist in the original
location.
<P>
B1 (and other types of) repeat &quot;loci&quot; should only be
given symbols if there is evidence of a unique locus (e.g. genetic
proof or polymorphism).
<P>
<I>Xrf</I> shall be used as the &quot;lab code&quot; in D symbols
that designate cross-referenced genes in mice and yeast or other
species. Symbols will be DChr#Xrf###, where ### is a serial number
assigned by the Johns Hopkins database. Typically a clone derived
from yeast may hit 2 (or more) mouse loci. These will not require
the -rs nomenclature because the clone number in the symbol will
identify relatedness between loci on different chromosomes. A
hyphenated serial number shall be used when two loci detected
by the same clone are on the same chromosome.<BR>
<P>
<U>Add to 1.1.3 after <I>Chromosomal regions detected cytologically
and by RFLPs</I> section</U>
<P>
Related sequence nomenclature (rs#) will be used for telomere
sequence loci recognized by polymorphic variants with telomere
sequences. Telomere sequences detected by cytogenetic methods
shall be symbolized Tel# like other chromosomal &quot;anomalies
or variants.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<U>Add to 1.1.6. Homology with other organisms</U>
<P>
<B>Note: </B>To describe conservation between species, &quot;synteny&quot;
should not be used synonymously with &quot;homology&quot; because
synteny means literally on the same thread or chromosome. The
appropriate phrases are &quot;conserved synteny&quot; when a gene
and its other species homolog are assigned to homologous chromosomes
in the mouse and the other species and &quot;conserved linkage&quot;
or &quot;conserved segment&quot; when the two genes are positionally
mapped within the same region on the two species'chromosomes.
&quot;Conserved ordered segment&quot; may be used when the order
of genes within the segment is conserved.<BR>
<P>
<U>Inbred Strains nomenclature<BR>
</U>
<P>
<U>Add to 14.1.2</U>
<P>
Inbred targeted mutation strains derived from only two strains
(including the ES cell line as one) but not exactly RI strains
may be designated using abbreviations for the two strains separated
by a comma, <I>e.g.</I> B6,129-gene symbol.<BR>
<P>
<U>Revise 14.1.8.</U> Use of the Laboratory Registration Code
to Designate Colony Holders
<P>
A particular colony <B>not known to be genetically different from
the parent colony (formerly called a subline)</B>, is now normally
indicated by appending a laboratory registration code to the end
of the strain/substrain symbol preceded by an &quot;@&quot; sign,
<I>e.g.</I> SJL@J, the colony of strain SJL bred at The Jackson Laboratory.........<BR>
