<P>
<CENTER>INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE ON STANDARDIZED GENETIC NOMENCLATURE
FOR MICE</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><I>Chairperson</I>: MURIEL T. DAVISSON<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
These rules were most recently published in:
<P>
International Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for
Mice, Chairperson: Davisson, M.T.: Rules and guidelines for genetic
nomenclature in mice. Mouse Genome 92 (1994) vii-xxxii.<BR>

<P>
Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice, Chairperson:
Davisson, M.T. Rules for nomenclature of chromosome anomalies,
pp. 1443-1445. In<I>: Genetic Variants and Strains of the Laboratory
Mouse</I>, Lyon, M.F., Rastan, S., and Brown, S.D.M. (eds.), Third
Edition, Volume 2, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1996.<BR>

<P>
These rules were extensively revised and adopted by the Committee
in 1993. They are the most recent version of rules for nomenclature
first published by the Committee 1981 (2), and revised in 1989
(3) and 1996 (above). Dated revisions are incorporated whenever
they are approved by the Committee.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="Symbols">2.1. Symbols for chromosome anomalies</A> <BR>

<P>
Chromosome anomaly symbols do not need to be italicized like gene
symbols<BR>

<P>
(a) Initial letter symbols shall be adopted as follows:
<P>
Cen Centromere
<P>
Del Deletion
<P>
Df Deficiency
<P>
Dp Duplication
<P>
Hc Pericentric heterochromatin
<P>
Hsr Homogeneous staining region
<P>
In Inversion
<P>
Is Insertion
<P>
Ms Monosomy
<P>
Ns Nullisomy
<P>
Rb Robertsonian translocation
<P>
Sp Supernumerary chromosome
<P>
T Translocation
<P>
Tel Telomere
<P>
Tet Tetrasomy
<P>
Tg Transgenic insertion (see rules for gene nomenclature)
<P>
Tp Transposition
<P>
Ts Trisomy<BR>

<P>
(b) Successive anomalies in a series shall be distinguished by
a series symbol, consisting of a number followed by the laboratory
registration code of the person or laboratory who discovered the
anomaly. This laboratory code should be that already assigned
for the designation of inbred substrains or sublines. If there
is no pre-assigned code, one should be obtained from the central
registry, currently maintained at the Institute of Laboratory
Animal Resources in Washington, D.C. U.S.A. The code should consist
of a two or three letter abbreviation, with only the first letter
capitalized, and should not duplicate an existing symbol in the
standard list of abbreviations, <I>e.g.</I> T37H (the 37th translocation
found at Harwell), In5Rk (the 5th inversion found by Roderick).
<BR>

<P>
(c) The chromosome(s) involved in the anomaly shall be indicated
by adding the appropriate Arabic numerals in parentheses, between
the initial letter and the series symbol, <I>e.g.</I> In(2)5Rk
indicates that the inversion in this case involves Chromosome
2.
<P>
Chromosomes shall be numbered and identified according to the
system given by Nesbitt and Francke (5), and extended by Evans
(4) and Sawyer <I>et al</I>. (6) and redrawn by Beechey (1).
<P>
The word Chromosome should start with a capital letter when referring
to a specific chromosome and may be abbreviated to Chr after the
first use, <I>e.g</I>. Chromosome (Chr) 1 and Chr 1. The X and
Y chromosomes shall be indicated by capital letters rather than
numbers.<BR>

<P>
(d) The two chromosomes involved in translocations and insertions
should be separated by a semi colon, whereas in Robertsonian translocations
the centromere should be indicated by a period (full stop), <I>e.g.</I>
T(4;X)37H and Rb(9.19)163H.
<P>
In the case of insertions, the number of the chromosome donating
the inserted portion should be given first; <I>e.g.</I> Is(7;1)40H,
an insertion of part of Chr 7 into Chr 1.<BR>

<P>
(e) When an animal carries two or more anomalies, which are potentially
separable by recombination, the symbols for both (or all) anomalies
should be given, <I>e.g. <BR>
</I>
<P>
Rb(16.17)Bnr T(1;17)190Ca/+ +, an animal carrying a Robertsonian
and a reciprocal translocation involving Chr 17, in &quot;coupling&quot;
<I>i.e.</I>, the same Chr 17 is involved in both;<BR>

<P>
Rb(5.15)3Bnr +/+ In(5)9Rk, an animal carrying a Robertsonian and
an inversion involving Chr 5 in &quot;repulsion&quot;.<BR>

<P>
(f) When one chromosome anomaly is contained within another or
inseparable from it, the symbols should be combined. <BR>

<P>
T(In1;5)44H, an animal carrying a translocation between Chrs 1
and 5 in which the Chr 1 segment is inverted.<BR>

<P>
(g) The symbols p and q should be used to denote the short and
long arms, respectively, of mouse chromosomes. In translocations,
breaks in the short arm should be designated with a p, but the
q for long arm may be omitted if the meaning is clear, <I>e.g.</I>
T(Yp;5)##, a translocation involving a break in the short arm
of the Y Chromosome and the long arm of Chr 5. Because mouse autosomes
and the X chromosome do not have a short arm other than a telomere
proximal to the centromere, most rearrangements in mouse chromosomes
involve breaks in the long arm.<BR>

<P>
(h) When the positions of the chromosomal breakpoints relative
to G-bands are known these shall be indicated by adding the band
numbers, as given in the standard karyotype of the mouse (1),
after the appropriate chromosome numbers, <I>e.g.<BR>
</I>
<P>
T(2H1;8A4)26H, a reciprocal translocation having breaks in band
H1 of Chr 2 and band A4 of Chr 8. In(XA1;XE)H, an inversion involving
breaks in bands A1 and E of the X chromosome; <BR>

<P>
Del(7E1)<I>c</I>8Rl, a deletion of band 7E1 manifesting as a mutation
to albino, <I>Tyr<SUP>c</SUP></I>;<BR>

<P>
Is(In7F1-7C; XF1)1Ct, an inverted insertion of a segment 7F1-7C
of Chr 7 into the X chromosome at band F1.<BR>

<P>
(i) For pericentric inversions the symbols pq and/or appropriate
band numbers should be used, <I>e.g.</I> In(Ypq), pericentric
inversion involving the Y chromosome; <BR>

<P>
In(8pqA2), pericentric inversion with breaks in the short arm
and in band A2 of the long arm;<BR>

<P>
In(5C2;15E1)Rb3Bnr 1Ct, the first inversion found by Cattanach
in Rb3Bnr, and involving bands 5C2 and 15E1.<BR>

<P>
(j) Deficiency and deletion are distinguished as follows. Deficiency
should be restricted to defining the unbalanced products of chromosome
aberrations, i.e. deficient/duplicated chromosomes resulting from
malsegregation of reciprocal translocations. Deletions are interstitial
losses often, although not always, cytologically visible. Neither
of these terms should be applied to small intragenic deletions.
These give rise to allelic variation in a single locus and are
given allele symbols. If cytologically visible deletions are first
detected by change in the phenotype produced by a gene (<I>e.g.</I>
<I>Mgf<SUP>Sl</SUP></I>), the gene and allele symbol designation
should be included in the chromosome anomal symbol, <I>e.g.</I>
Del(10)<I>Mgf<SUP>Sl-12</SUP></I>1H was originally identified
as <I>Sl<SUP>12H</SUP>. </I>(see rules for gene nomenclature,
section 1.1.7) <BR>

<P>
(k) Trisomies and monosomies should be denoted by the appropriate
initial symbol, followed by the chromosome(s) concerned in parentheses,
e.g. Ts16, and by the translocation number if the trisomy, etc.,
is derived from a translocation, <I>e.g.</I> Ts(1<SUP>13</SUP>)70H,
trisomy for the proximal end of 1 and the distal end of 13, derived
from T(1;13)70H. Nullisomy, monosomy, and tetrasomy are denoted
similarly. <BR>

<P>
<A NAME="Variations">2.2. Variations in heterochromatin and chromosome
banding</A><BR>

<P>
(a) <I>Nucleolus organizers</I>. The symbol NOR should be reserved
for nucleolus organizers. Different organizers should be distinguished
by chromosome numbers. Polymorphic loci within the ribosomal DNA
region are designated with gene symbols, <I>Rnr </I>and the chromosome
number (see guidelines for gene nomenclature); <I>e.g.</I> <I>Rnr12</I>
is a polymorphic DNA segment that identifies the ribosomal DNA
region on Chr 12. <BR>

<P>
(b) <I>Pericentric heterochromatin.</I> The symbol H should be
used for heterochromatin visualized cytologically, followed by
a symbol indicating the chromosome region involved, in this case
c for centromeric, and a number indicating the chromosome on which
it lies, <I>e.g.</I> Hc14 - pericentric heterochromatin on Chr
14. Variations in size, etc., of any block should be indicated
by superscripts, using n for normal or standard, l for large and
s for small bands; <I>e.g.</I> Hc14<SUP>n</SUP> - normal or standard
pericentric heterochromatin on Chr 14. In describing a new variant
a single inbred strain should be named as the prototype or standard
strain. Individual loci or DNA segments mapped within heterochromatin
should be symbolized with D- symbols. A lowercase <I>h</I> may
follow the <I>D</I> to indicate the DNA locus is a genetic marker
for the heterochromatin region, <I>e.g. Dh1H1</I>, the first DNA
segment within the pericentromeric heterochromatin region of Chr
1 discovered at Harwell.<BR>

<P>
(c) <I>Centromeres.</I> The centromere itself (as opposed to pericentric
heterchromatin) should be denoted by the symbol Cen. Individual
loci or DNA segments mapped within the centromere region should
be symbolized with D- symbols.<BR>

<P>
(d) <I>Telomeres</I>. The telomere should be denoted by the symbol
Tel. The symbol <I>Tel</I> may be substituted for D in a locus
symbol that refers to a locus recognized by a telomere consensus
sequence probe. Symbols for such loci (mapping to the telomere
region) are italicized and consist of three parts:<BR>

<P>
1) The letters <I>Tel</I> (for telomere).<BR>

<P>
2) A number denoting the chromosome <I>e.g</I>. <I>Tel14</I> -
a telomere sequence on Chromosome 14.<BR>

<P>
3) A letter denoting the centromeric or distal end of the chromosome,
namely p for centromeric and q for distal (derived from p and
q for short and long arms, respectively).<BR>

<P>
4) Multiple loci assigned to telomeres of individual chromosomes
are numbered serially.
<P>
<I>e.g</I>. <I>Tel14p1</I> - the first telomere sequence mapped
at the centromeric end of Chr 14; <I>Tel19q2</I> - the second
telomere sequence mapped at the distal end of Chr 19. Telomeric
sequences mapped to other chromosome regions should be designated
as -rs loci (see gene nomenclature, Section 1.1.2 (4)).<BR>

<P>
(e) <I>G-band polymorphisms</I>. When a recognizable and heritable
variant in size, staining density, etc. of a particular chromosomal
G-band is discovered, this should be indicated by giving the designation
of the band affected, in accordance with the standard karyotype
of the mouse, with a superscript to indicate the variant concerned,
<I>e.g.</I> 17A2<SUP>s</SUP> - small A2 band in Chr 17.
<P>
When a supernumerary band becomes visible, this may be due to
a small duplication, and if so should be designated as such (see
Section 10.1). If the supernumerary band is due not to a duplication
but to a further resolution within a band then a new band should
be designated, as a subdivision of the appropriate known band.
<P>
Thus, if the known band has a letter but no numbered subdivisions,
then such numbered subdivisions should be created. If numbered
subdivisions require to be further subdivided then a decimal system
should be used, i.e. band 17B should be divided into 17B1, 17B2,
etc.; further subdivision would lead to 17B1.1, 17B1.2, etc.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="Use">2.3. Use of human chromosome nomenclature</A> <BR>

<P>
Chromosomal complements may be described using the type of nomenclature
used for human chromosomes when dealing with whole arm changes
or mosaics; <I>e.g.</I> 41,XY+13, or 39,X//41,XYY, using a double
slash to separate the components of the mosaic. <BR>
