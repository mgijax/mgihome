These rules were extensively revised and adopted by the Committee in 1993. They are the most recent version of rules for nomenclature first published by the Committee 1981(2), and revised in 1989 (3) and 1996 (above). Dated revisions are incorporated whenever they are approved by the Committee.<BR>

<h2><A NAME="Symbols">1<spacer type=horizontal size=52>Symbols for Chromosome Anomalies</A></h2>

<P>Chromosome anomaly symbols do not need to be italicized like gene symbols.
<ol type=a>
<li>Initial letter symbols shall be adopted as follows:
<table width="100%" border=0 cellpadding=4>
<tr><td width="10%">Cen <td> Centromere</tr>
<tr><td>Del  <td> Deletion </tr>
<tr><td>Df   <td>Deficiency</tr>
<tr><td>Dp   <td>Duplication</tr>
<tr><td>Hc   <td>Pericentric heterochromatin</tr>
<tr><td>Hsr  <td>Homogeneous staining region</tr>
<tr><td>In   <td>Inversion</tr>
<tr><td>Is   <td>Insertion</tr>
<tr><td>Ms   <td>Monosomy</tr>
<tr><td>Ns   <td>Nullisomy</tr>
<tr><td>Rb   <td>Robertsonian translocation</tr>
<tr><td>Sp   <td>Supernumerary chromosome</tr>
<tr><td>T    <td>Translocation</tr>
<tr><td>Tel  <td>Telomere</tr>
<tr><td>Tet  <td>Tetrasomy</tr>
<tr><td>Tg   <td>Transgenic insertion (see <a href="gene.shtml">Rules and Guidelines for Gene, Allele, and Mutation Nomenclature</a>)</tr>
<tr><td>Tp   <td>Transpositionaa</tr>
<tr><td>Ts   <td>Trisomy<BR>
</table><br>
<li>Successive anomalies in a series shall be distinguished by a series symbol, consisting of a number followed by the laboratory registration code of the person or laboratory who discovered the anomaly. This laboratory code should be that already assigned for the designation of inbred substrains or sublines. If there is no pre-assigned code, one should be obtained from the central registry, currently maintained at the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources in Washington, D.C. U.S.A. The code should consist of a two or three letter abbreviation, with only the first letter capitalized, and should not duplicate an existing symbol in the standard list of abbreviations, <I>e.g.</I> T37H (the 37th translocation found at Harwell), In5Rk (the 5th inversion found by Roderick).
<p>
<li>The chromosome(s) involved in the anomaly shall be indicated by adding the appropriate Arabic numerals in parentheses, between the initial letter and the series symbol, <I>e.g.</I> In(2)5Rk indicates that the inversion in this case involves Chromosome 2.   
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Chromosomes shall be numbered and identified according to the system given by Nesbitt and Francke (5), and extended by Evans (4) and Sawyer <I>et al</I>. (6) and redrawn by Beechey (1).<br><br>
  <li>The word <i>Chromosome</i> should start with a capital letter when referring to a specific chromosome and may be abbreviated to Chr after the first use, <I>e.g</I>. Chromosome (Chr) 1 and Chr 1. The X and Y chromosomes shall be indicated by capital letters rather than numbers.
  </ul>
<p>
<li>The two chromosomes involved in translocations and insertions should be separated by a semi colon, whereas in Robertsonian translocations the centromere should be indicated by a period (full stop),  <I>e.g.</I> T(4;X)37H and Rb(9.19)163H.
  <p>
   <ul>
   <li>In the case of insertions, the number of the chromosome donating the inserted portion should be given first; <I>e.g.</I> Is(7;1)40H, an insertion of part of Chr 7 into Chr 1.
  </ul>
  <p>
<li> When an animal carries two or more anomalies, which are potentially separable by recombination, the symbols for both (or all) anomalies should be given, <I>e.g. </I>
  <p>
   <ul>
   <li>Rb(16.17)Bnr T(1;17)190Ca/+ +, an animal carrying a Robertsonian and a reciprocal translocation involving Chr 17, in &quot;coupling&quot; <I>i.e.</I>, the same Chr 17 is involved in both;<br><br>
   <li>Rb(5.15)3Bnr +/+ In(5)9Rk, an animal carrying a Robertsonian and an inversion involving Chr 5 in &quot;repulsion.&quot;
</ul>
<p>
<li>When one chromosome anomaly is contained within another or inseparable from it, the symbols should be combined. 

  <P>
  <ul>
  <li>T(In1;5)44H, an animal carrying a translocation between Chrs 1 and 5 in which the Chr 1 segment is inverted.
   </ul>
   <p>
<li>The symbols p and q should be used to denote the short and long arms, respectively, of mouse chromosomes. In translocations, breaks in the short arm should be designated with a p, but the q for long arm may be omitted if the meaning is clear, <I>e.g.</I> T(Yp;5)##, a translocation involving a break in the short arm of the Y Chromosome and the long arm of Chr 5. Because mouse autosomes and the X chromosome do not have a short arm other than a telomere proximal to the centromere, most rearrangements in mouse chromosomes involve breaks in the long arm.<BR><br>

<li>When the positions of the chromosomal breakpoints relative to G-bands are known these shall be indicated by adding the band
numbers, as given in the standard karyotype of the mouse (1), after the appropriate chromosome numbers, <I>e.g.</I>:
  <p>
  <ul>
  <li>T(2H1;8A4)26H, a reciprocal translocation having breaks in band H1 of Chr 2 and band A4 of Chr 8. In(XA1;XE)H, an inversion involving breaks in bands A1 and E of the X chromosome;   <br><br>
  <li>Del(7E1)<I>c</I>8Rl, a deletion of band 7E1 manifesting as a mutation to albino, <I>Tyr<SUP>c</SUP></I>; <br><br>
  <li>Is(In7F1-7C; XF1)1Ct, an inverted insertion of a segment 7F1-7C of Chr 7 into the X chromosome at band F1. 
  </ul>
  <p>
<li>For pericentric inversions the symbols pq and/or appropriate band numbers should be used, <I>e.g.
<p>
  <ul>
  <li></I> In(Ypq), pericentric inversion involving the Y chromosome; <BR><br>
  <li>In(8pqA2), pericentric inversion with breaks in the short arm and in band A2 of the long arm;<BR><br>
  <li>In(5C2;15E1)Rb3Bnr 1Ct, the first inversion found by Cattanach in Rb3Bnr, and involving bands 5C2 and 15E1.
</ul><br><br>
<li>Deficiency and deletion are distinguished as follows. Deficiency should be restricted to defining the unbalanced products of chromosome aberrations, i.e., deficient/duplicated chromosomes resulting from malsegregation of reciprocal translocations. Deletions are interstitial losses often, although not always, cytologically visible. Neither of these terms should be applied to small intragenic deletions. These give rise to allelic variation in a single locus and are given allele symbols. If cytologically visible deletions are first detected by change in the phenotype produced by a gene (<I>e.g.</I><I>Mgf<SUP>Sl</SUP></I>), the gene and allele symbol designation should be included in the chromosome anomal symbol, <I>e.g.</I> Del(10)<I>Mgf<SUP>Sl-12</SUP></I>1H was originally identified as <I>Sl<SUP>12H</SUP> </I>(see <a href="gene.shtml#fih">Rules and Guidelines for Gene, Allele, and Mutation Nomenclature</a>). <BR><br>

<li>Trisomies and monosomies should be denoted by the appropriate initial symbol, followed by the chromosome(s) concerned in parentheses, e.g. Ts16, and by the translocation number if the trisomy, etc., is derived from a translocation, <I>e.g.</I> Ts(1<SUP>13</SUP>)70H, trisomy for the proximal end of 1 and the distal end of 13, derived from T(1;13)70H. Nullisomy, monosomy, and tetrasomy are denoted similarly. 
</ol>
<h2><A NAME="Variations">2<spacer type=horizontal size=52>Variations in Heterochromatin and Chromosome Banding</A></h2>
<ol type=a>
<li><I>Nucleolus organizers</I>. The symbol NOR should be reserved for nucleolus organizers. Different organizers should be distinguished by chromosome numbers. Polymorphic loci within the ribosomal DNA region are designated with gene symbols, <I>Rnr </I>and the chromosome number ( see <a href="gene.shtml">Rules and Guidelines for Gene, Allele, and Mutation Nomenclature</a>) <I>e.g.</I> <I>Rnr12</I> is a polymorphic DNA segment that identifies the ribosomal DNA region on Chr 12.<BR><br>

<li><I>Pericentric heterochromatin.</I> The symbol H should be used for heterochromatin visualized cytologically, followed by a symbol indicating the chromosome region involved, in this case <b>c</b> for centromeric, and a number indicating the chromosome on which it lies, <I>e.g.</I> Hc14 - pericentric heterochromatin on Chr 14. Variations in size, etc., of any block should be indicated by superscripts, using n for normal or standard, l for large and s for small bands; <I>e.g.</I> Hc14<SUP>n</SUP> - normal or standard pericentric heterochromatin on Chr 14. In describing a new variant a single inbred strain should be named as the prototype or standard strain. Individual loci or DNA segments mapped within heterochromatin should be symbolized with D- symbols. A lowercase <I>h</I> may follow the <I>D</I> to indicate the DNA locus is a genetic marker for the heterochromatin region, <I>e.g. Dh1H1</I>, the first DNA segment within the pericentromeric heterochromatin region of Chr 1 discovered at Harwell.<BR><br>

<li><I>Centromeres.</I> The centromere itself (as opposed to pericentric heterchromatin) should be denoted by the symbol Cen. Individual loci or DNA segments mapped within the centromere region should be symbolized with D- symbols.<BR><br>

<li><I>Telomeres</I>. The telomere should be denoted by the symbol Tel. The symbol <I>Tel</I> may be substituted for D in a locus symbol that refers to a locus recognized by a telomere consensus sequence probe. Symbols for such loci (mapping to the telomere region) are italicized and consist of three parts:<BR>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li> The letters <I>Tel</I> (for telomere).<BR><br>

<li>A number denoting the chromosome <I>e.g</I>. <I>Tel14</I> - a telomere sequence on Chromosome 14.<BR><br>

<li>A letter denoting the centromeric or distal end of the chromosome, namely p for centromeric and q for distal (derived from p and q for short and long arms, respectively).<BR><br>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p>Multiple loci assigned to telomeres of individual chromosomes are numbered serially.<BR><br>

<I>e.g</I>. <I>Tel14p1</I> - the first telomere sequence mapped at the centromeric end of Chr 14; <I>Tel19q2</I> - the second telomere sequence mapped at the distal end of Chr 19. Telomeric sequences mapped to other chromosome regions should be designated as -rs loci (see <a href="gene.shtml">Rules and Guidelines for Gene, Allele, and Mutation Nomenclature</a> and (6)</a>.<BR><br>

<li> <I>G-band polymorphisms</I>. When a recognizable and heritable variant in size, staining density, etc. of a particular chromosomal G-band is discovered, this should be indicated by giving the designation of the band affected, in accordance with the standard karyotype of the mouse, with a superscript to indicate the variant concerned, <I>e.g.</I> 17A2<SUP>s</SUP> - small A2 band in Chr 17.<br><br>
<ul>
<li>When a supernumerary band becomes visible, this may be due to a small duplication, and if so should be designated as such. If the supernumerary band is due not to a duplication but to a further resolution within a band then a new band should be designated, as a subdivision of the appropriate known band.<BR><br>
<li>
Thus, if the known band has a letter but no numbered subdivisions, then such numbered subdivisions should be created. If numbered subdivisions require to be further subdivided then a decimal system should be used, i.e. band 17B should be divided into 17B1, 17B2, etc.; further subdivision would lead to 17B1.1, 17B1.2, etc.<BR><br>

<h2><A NAME="Use">3<spacer type=horizontal size=52>Use of Human Chromosome Nomenclature</A></h2>
<P>Chromosomal complements may be described using the type of nomenclature used for human chromosomes when dealing with whole arm changes or mosaics; <I>e.g.</I> 41,XY+13, or 39,X//41,XYY, using a double slash to separate the components of the mosaic.
