<P>These rules were most recently published in: </P>
<P>International Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice,
Chairperson: Davisson, M.T.: Rules and guidelines for genetic nomenclature
in mice. Mouse Genome 92 (1994) vii-xxxii.</P>
<P>Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice, Chairperson:
Davisson, M.T. Rules and guidelines for gene nomenclature, pp. 1-16. In:<I>
Genetic Variants and Strains of the Laboratory Mouse</I>, Lyon, M.F.,
Rastan, S., Brown, S.D.M. (eds.), Third Edition, Volume 1, Oxford
University Press, Oxford, 1996.</P>
<P>These rules were extensively revised and adopted by the Committee in
1993. They are the most recent version of rules for nomenclature first
published by Dunn, Gruneberg, and Snell in 1940 (5), revised by the
Committee in 1963 (1), 1973 (2), 1981 (3), 1989 (4) and in 1996 (above).
Dated revisions are incorporated whenever they are approved by the
Committee.</P>
<P><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</A> </P>
<P>Gene nomenclature guidelines are based upon the premise that the primary
purpose of a gene or locus symbol is to provide a brief and universally
acceptable symbol that uniquely identifies a specific gene or locus; all
other purposes of a symbol are secondary and should not interfere with this
primary purpose. Gene names, brief descriptive phrases that define the
symbol, and gene descriptions in publications and electronic databases,
should be the primary means for conveying information about the gene.
Complex information about a gene or locus, such as the properties of the
assay used to identify it, should be conveyed in the description
accompanying the gene and not part of the unique identifying symbol. </P>
<P><A NAME="Rules">1.1. Rules for gene nomenclature</A> </P>
<P><A NAME="Names">1.1.1. Names of genes or loci</A> </P>
<P>Names of genes and loci should be brief and should be chosen to convey
as accurately as possible the character by which the gene is usually
recognized. Such a character may range from a coat colour or morphological
effect to change in an enzyme or other protein, disease susceptibility or
resistance, resemblance to a human syndrome or a DNA sequence identified by
a DNA probe or a specific assay, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or
simple sequence polymorphism (SSCP) detection. Genes are functional units,
whereas a locus can be any distinct, recognizable DNA sequence (see 1.1.3).
Hyphens shall be deleted from gene names as well as symbols.</P>
<P><A NAME="Symbols">1.1.2. Symbols for genes</A> </P>
<P>Symbols for genes should typically be two-, three-, or four-letter
abbreviations of the name. For convenience in alphabetical listings, the
initial letters of names and symbols should, where possible, be the same.
Arabic numbers may be included, <I>e.g.</I> for proteins in which a number
is part of the recognized name or abbreviation or to designate members of a
series, but the symbol should always begin with a letter, <I>e.g.</I>
<I>G6pd</I>, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; <I>B2m</I>,
b2-microglobulin; <I>C3</I> and <I>C4, </I>third and fourth components of
complement, respectively. Roman numbers and Greek letters should not be
used. Names of persons or places, in general, are discouraged in gene names
or symbols. Symbols for related genes, such as genes in the same family,
usually have a common stem symbol of 2-3 characters followed by 1-2
distinguishing characters to make each symbol unique (see 1.1.5). Some
characters at the ends of symbols have special meaning; <I>e.g.</I>
<I>r</I> is commonly used for receptor and regulatory loci, <I>bp</I> is
commonly used for binding protein loci, and <I>e </I>is added to DNA locus
symbols to indicate they are expressed. Gene symbols ending in <I>v</I>
should be reserved for virological genes.</P>
<P>1. Henceforth, hyphens will only be used in gene symbols for clarity,
primarily to separate characters that together might be confusing,
<I>e.g.</I> </P>
<P>(1) two numbers that would be in adjacent positions, such as
<I>Lamb1-2</I>, </P>
<P>(2) -<I>rs</I> and -<I>ps</I> (related sequence and pseudogene,
respectively, see 1.1.4) from gene symbols, </P>
<P>(3) as required, characters for loci in a complex from the complex
symbol (see 1.1.12 and 1.2.1), </P>
<P>(4) components of mutant allele symbols, such as
<I>Mod1<SUP>a-m1Lws</I></SUP>(see 1.1.7.7). </P>
<P>(Approved 1993)</P>
<P>Hyphens are to be deleted from symbols existing prior to 1993, except in
the cases listed in (1)-(4).</P>
<P>2. The total number of characters in a locus symbol should not exceed
10, except where this maximum would cause violation of some other rule. D
symbols for homologs of other species' DNA loci may sometimes exceed 10;
<I>e.g. D11H17S111e</I> if this locus were shown to be expressed in mice
(<I>e</I>) or in human beings (E). Additional information can be included
in the gene name if necessary.</P>
<P>3. Except in the case of loci first discovered because of a recessive
mutation (see Section 1.1.7), the initial letter of the locus symbol should
be capital, and all others lower case. </P>
<P>4. In published articles gene symbols should be set in italics,
<I>e.g.</I> <I>Pit1<SUP>dw</I></SUP>, dwarf; <I>Hbb</I>, haemoglobin <FONT
FACE="Symbol">b</FONT>-chain. </P>
<P>5. Identification of new loci should not be assumed from the discovery
of variation, whether morphological, biochemical, quantitative or
antigenic. Appropriate genetic tests should be made to show Mendelian
segregation, and identity or not with known loci should be established as
far as possible by mapping or tests for allelism. Loci may also be
identified by any other method that defines a unique map position, such as
somatic cell genetics, <I>in situ</I> hybridization to chromosomes or
studies of DNA, but bear in mind that cloning a DNA segment does not
necessarily identify a new locus.</P>
<P>6. A proposed new symbol must not duplicate one already used for another
locus, even if the gene effect is very different. Listing of a gene symbol
in <I>Mouse Genome</I>, or date of publication in a refereed journal
provided the symbol is acceptable, establishes priority. When choosing a
new locus symbol, check for uniqueness with the Mouse Genomic Database at
The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, U.S.A., the editor of <I>Mouse
Genome</I> at the MRC Radiobiology Unit, Chilton, England or a current
locus list (published annually in <I>Mouse Genome</I> and in chromosome
committee reports in <I>Mammalian Genome</I>).</P>
<P>7. When a well-known locus has been recognized initially by a mutation
and later the structural locus is identified, the locus is identified by
the symbol for the structural locus and the mutant allele symbol is
designated as a superscript to the structural locus symbol, e.g. <I>W</I>,
which is a mutation in <I>Kit</I>, becomes <I>Kit<SUP>W</I></SUP>.</P>
<P>(8-11 below approved 11/95) </P>
<P>8. Symbols for quantitative trait loci (QTL) genes shall follow the
rules for other types of genes (see 1.1.1). They should be symbolized with
3-4 character symbols that are acronyms of the name and begin with a
capital letter. Those affecting the same complex trait, i.e. in a series
like <I>Idd</I> loci, shall be given the same stem symbol and serially
numbered. "q" may be used as the final letter preceding the serial number
but is not required.</P>
<P>9. Expressed sequence tagged (EST) loci, when mapped to chromosomes, may
be given either D symbols with a final <I>e</I> for <U>e</U>xpressed or the
symbol <I>ESTM###</I>, where M identifies mouse as opposed to human EST
loci.and ### = a serial number assigned from the Mouse Genome Database
(MGD).</P>
<P>10. Genes encoded by the opposite (anti-sense) strand of a known gene
shall be given their own symbols.</P>
<P>11. Alternate transcripts from the same gene should not be given
different "locus" symbols.</P>
<P><A NAME="Genes">1.1.3. Genes and loci recognized by DNA sequence</A> </P>
<P>A gene, including both transcribed DNA sequences and associated
regulatory elements, can span a considerable length of chromosomal DNA.
Sequences at many places in a gene might, therefore, vary from strain to
strain of mouse, and each variation could be any of several kinds: point
substitutions, insertions or deletions (<I>e.g.</I> of retroviral
elements), and variations in simple sequence repeat numbers. Each such
variant has the potential to define a distinct genetic <I>locus</I> or DNA
segment, given a specific <I>assay</I> and appropriately recombinant mice,
and the full set of variants possessed by any given form of <I>gene</I> or
length of chromosomal DNA defines a <I>haplotype</I>. The term haplotype is
also used to define a complement of alleles at multiple loci within a
complex (see Sections 1.2.1 and 1.2.3). </P>
<P>To describe the results of a DNA typing assay unambiguously,
investigators should, therefore, give the gene name and symbol, the assay
(<I>e.g.</I> probe or PCR primers, and restriction enzyme if any), and, if
a specific DNA segment within the gene is being assayed, the D locus
symbol. An important function of chromosome committees and of databases is
to assemble such data to define haplotypes for genes. To avoid ambiguity,
assay names and probe names should not resemble D symbols; use of the
letter D should be reserved for DNA loci. </P>
<P>D-symbols are used in two ways: </P>
<P>1. Loci recognized by anonymous DNA probes should be given D-symbols.
This use of D symbols as gene or locus symbols should be reserved for
anonymous DNA loci distinct from known genes. </P>
<P>2. Intragenic loci may be given D symbols to distinguish individual
sites within a gene. Remember that genes are functional units whereas loci
can be any distinct DNA segment, and that several variant D-loci may lie
within, and be used to assay, a gene. Variation in DNA sequence of a known
gene or tightly linked sequences should be described using the gene symbol
and current rules for nomenclature of genes and alleles. Intragenic D-locus
symbols should only be used (a) when describing intragenic mapping analysis
or (b) when stating that a gene was typed using an intragenic D-locus (see
next paragraph for the most common example of this). </P>
<P>NOTE: While D symbols could be given to all variants within a gene, the
Committee discourages the use of D symbols for intragenic DNA segments
except when a D locus symbol is needed to relate a segment to other objects
within or near the gene. YAC ends may be given D symbols when they are used
for genetic mapping. (Note approved 11/95) </P>
<P>Loci recognized by variation in copy number of mini- or microsatellites
should be given D symbols. If such microsatellite (D-symbol) loci are
within or very near known genes and, thus, can be used to detect those
genes, then the gene symbol should <I>always</I> be used to refer to the
gene, <I>e.g.</I> the gene's location on the chromosome, and the D-symbols
should <I>only be used</I> to refer to specific sites within the gene,
<I>e.g.</I> to convey intragenic mapping information. When D-symbol loci
fall within known genes, on general maps the gene will be identified by the
gene symbol and the locus (D-) symbols will appear in locus lists and
databases cross-referenced with the gene. Locus symbols would, of course,
be used on fine structure, high resolution maps around and within genes.
</P>
<P>D-symbols are composed of four parts: </P>
<P>(1) D for DNA. </P>
<P>(2) 1 ..... 19, X and Y for the chromosomal assignment, and 0 for
unmapped loci. </P>
<P>(3) A 2-3 letter laboratory registration code indicating the laboratory
or scientist describing the locus. The same symbol should be used for a
laboratory's loci, chromosome aberrations, and inbred substrains,
<I>e.g.</I> Pas for Pasteur Institute. Only the first letter of the
laboratory code is capitalized. Laboratory registration codes are assigned
from a central registry and can be obtained by contacting the Institute of
Laboratory Animal Resources (ILAR) in Washington, D.C., U.S.A. (see most
recent <I>Mouse Genome</I> for contact person and address). For a current
list of approved lab codes or to register a new lab code, use the WWW and
go to URL address <A
HREF="http://www4.nationalacademies.org/cls/ilarhome.nsf">http://www4.nationalacademies.org/cls/ilarhome.nsf</A>. </P>
<P>(4) A unique serial number. It is preferred that numbers be assigned to
loci in the order the loci are described on each chromosome for a
particular laboratory, <I>e.g.</I> <I>D1Pas5</I>&nbsp; the fifth D-locus
developed and mapped on Chromosome 1 at the Pasteur Institute. The use of a
number from the probe that detects the locus, <I>e.g.</I> <I>D17Leh48</I>,
a Chromosome 17 D-locus identified by probe number Tu48 of Lehrach, is
discouraged.</P>
<P>Recognizing that allelic variation detected by DNA probes can be
complex, the Committee proposes the following. In published papers, the
allele type of a specific strain should be given by fragment(s) size with a
description of the assay used. When simple allele symbols are required, as
for display of linkage data or listing in databases or locus lists, a
single letter abbreviation for the strain should be used (see Alleles,
section 1.1.7.9). Allele symbols should be written as a lowercase
superscript when appended to the locus symbol; in tables of linkage data in
publications a single uppercase letter denoting the strain may be used. The
assay or restriction enzyme must be specified for each allele used in a
publication or entered into a database, because the same two strains may
differ with one assay but be indistinguishable with another. That is, a
strain may have different "alleles" depending on the assay or restriction
enzyme. The single symbol may be thought of as designating the haplotype
for that gene or segment of DNA (see Section 1.1.3, para. 1 and Section
1.1.7, general rules for allelic designation). </P>
<P>If an anonymous DNA locus identified only by the D symbol is later
identified to be a known locus or the function of the gene is determined,
the D symbol should either be replaced by the known gene's symbol or
changed to a new gene symbol that is an acronym for the new gene's name. If
more than one mutation is identified within the gene, the original D symbol
should be retained for the mutated site it originally designated (see
Section 1.1.3, para. 3). If a D locus is shown to be expressed but its
function remains unknown, a lower case "e" for expressed should be added to
the D symbol, <I>e.g.</I> <I>D1Pas5e</I>. Newly identified expressed genes
for which the gene product is unknown should also be given D symbols
followed by "e." </P>
<P>Anonymous DNA loci from the human genome that cross hybridize with mouse
DNA and are mapped to a mouse chromosome retain their human symbol in all
uppercase and the mouse chromosome number and a capital H, for human, are
inserted after the D, <I>e.g.</I> <I>D16H21S56</I> is a <U>D</U> locus on
mouse Chromosome <U>16</U> that cross hybridizes with the probe for the
<U>56</U>th <U>s</U>ingle sequence DNA locus from <U>h</U>uman Chromosome
<U>21</U>. Similarly, single letter abbreviations for other species can be
added as this situation arises for D loci derived from other species. These
abbreviations will be assigned by the International Nomenclature Committee
to assure that each letter unambiguously indicates the species of origin.
If a unique locus in another species identifies more than one mouse locus,
the related sequence convention should be used (see 1.1.4). </P>
<P>Alternate or new loci detected with primers for a known locus belong to
the lab discovering them and shall be symbolized by that lab with its lab
code and next serial number on the chromosome. "Mismapped" loci should only
be resymbolized if it can be proved that the original locus does not exist
in the original location. </P>
<P>B1 (and other types of) repeat "loci" should only be given symbols if
there is evidence of a unique locus (e.g. genetic proof or polymorphism).
</P>
<I><P>Xrf</I> shall be used as the "lab code" in D symbols that designate
cross-referenced genes in mice and yeast or other species. Symbols will be
<I>DChr#Xrf###</I>, where ### is a serial number assigned by the Johns
Hopkins database. Typically a clone derived from yeast may hit 2 (or more)
mouse loci. These will not require the -rs nomenclature because the clone
number in the symbol will identify relatedness between loci on different
chromosomes. A hyphenated serial number shall be used when two loci
detected by the same clone are on the same chromosome. (above three
paragraphs approved 11/95) </P>
<I><P>Chromosomal regions detected cytologically and by RFLPs. </I>At least
five chromosomal regions can be detected by a specific cytological staining
method that reveals the whole region or loci within the region can be
detected with DNA probes: centromeres, pericentromeric heterochromatin
(C-bands), nucleolus organizer regions (NORs), homogeneously staining
regions (HSRs), and telomeres. Chromosomal nomenclature guidelines should
be followed for cytologically detected chromosomal regions and gene
nomenclature for genetic loci. While we recognize the distinction blurs,
please try to follow these guidelines; contact a member of the
International Nomenclature Committee if in doubt. <I>Hc# </I>is the symbol
for a cytologically detected C-band; loci recognized by DNA polymorphisms
in heterochromatin should be given D locus symbols. Centromeres are
designated by the symbol <I>Cen </I>when detected cytologically or referred
to as a unit. If it becomes possible and necessary to distinguish loci or
segments within the centromere, these should be given D locus symbols.
Polymorphic loci within NORs are symbolized <I>Rnr#</I>, where <I>Rnr</I> =
ribosomal RNA and # = the chromosome on which the locus is located. If more
than one <I>Rnr</I> locus on the same chromosome is distinguished by
genetic means, the loci should be serially numbered in order of
identification, <I>e.g.</I> <I>Rnr1-1,</I> <I>Rnr1-2</I>. For homogeneously
staining regions, HSR is incorporated into a chromosome aberration symbol
(see chromosome guidelines) or a D symbol is assigned to the locus
amplified and Hsr is added when it is amplified, <I>e.g. D1Lub1Hsr</I>.
Related sequence nomenclature (rs#) will be used for telomere sequence loci
recognized by polymorphic variants with telomere sequences. Telomere
sequences detected by cytogenetic methods shall be symbolized Tel# like
other chromosomal "anomalies or variants." (last two sentences approved
11/95)</P>
<P><A NAME="Pseudogenes">1.1.4. Pseudogenes, related sequence genes</A> </P>
<P>Often multiple loci are detected with a single DNA probe, because they
have similar or <U>r</U>elated <U>s</U>equences. Frequently such loci are
located away from the main gene complex. </P>
<I><P>Pseudogenes</I>. If a locus related by sequence is proved to be a
pseudogene, it should be denoted by the suffix <I>ps</I>, separated from
the locus symbol by a hyphen, and followed by an appropriate serial number;
<I>e.g.</I> <I>Hba-ps3</I>, <I>Hba-ps4,</I> pseudogenes of a-globin located
away from the <I>Hba</I> complex, <I>Pgk1-ps2</I>, the second pseudogene to
the functional <I>Pgk1</I> locus. </P>
<I><P>Related sequence loci. </I>It is often not clear whether the multiple
loci are pseudogenes. These loci should be symbolized by adding <I>rs</I>
to the symbol of the primary locus that the probe identifies. The
definition of such loci is "any locus that is recognized by the same
probe." For example, the first related locus identified by the elastase-1
gene (<I>Ela1</I>) probe would be designated <I>Ela1-rs1</I>. If it is not
known which locus in a series is the structural locus, all loci get an
<I>rs</I> symbol. When the structural locus is identified, the <I>rs </I>is
dropped from the symbol for that locus. The use of <I>rs</I> in symbols
should be restricted to sequences related to coding or genic sequences and
not to sequences related to anonymous probes, such as minisatellite
families.</P>
<P><A NAME="Families">1.1.5. Loci that are members of a series or
families</A> </P>
<P>Loci that are members of a series specifying similar proteins or other
characters (<I>e.g.</I> isoenzymes, lymphocyte antigens, and
histocompatibility antigen gene families, should be designated by the same
character symbol with the addition of distinguishing serial number,
<I>e.g.</I> <I>H1</I>, <I>H2</I>, etc., for histocompatibility loci;
<I>Es1</I>, <I>Es2</I>, etc., for esterase loci. Hyphens are not used
except as indicated in 1.1.2. </P>
<P>When one member of a series is further subdivided by numbers, hyphens
may be used to enumerate the series for the multilocus member. For example,
the probe for <I>Lamb1 </I>recognizes more than one locus, so this series
becomes <I>Lamb1-1, Lamb1-2, Lamb2</I>. </P>
<P>For morphological or "visible" loci with similar effects (<I>e.g.</I>
"waltzing" genes, hair-waving genes) distinctive names should be given
since the gene actions and gene products may ultimately prove to be very
different, <I>e.g.</I> <I>v</I>, waltzer, and <I>Krml<SUP>kr</I></SUP>,
kreisler. </P>
<P>Genes that are members of a family should have a common stem or root of
2-3 letters, <I>e.g.</I> <I>Gn</I> for the guanine nucleoside (G-)
proteins. Note, however, that members of a superfamily, <I>e.g.</I> with
related functions or amino acid sequence homology may have different
symbols based on their individual functions, for example, the "ras"
superfamily includes ras oncogene and small GTP-binding proteins.</P>
<P><A NAME="Homology">1.1.6. Homology with other organisms</A> </P>
<P>It is highly desirable that terminology for homologous genes should be
standardized among species. Therefore, when choosing a gene symbol an
attempt should first be made to discover and use any symbols already
adopted for this gene in other species. However, care should be taken that
such symbols <I>do not duplicate any already in use in the mouse </I>for
other loci. If duplication would occur, then the symbol should be modified
to one resembling that used in the other species as closely as possible but
not duplicating a symbol used for a different gene in that (or another)
species, <I>e.g.</I> carbonic anhydrase: man <I>CA</I>, mouse, <I>Car</I>;
catalase, man <I>CAT</I>, mouse <I>Cas</I>. Frequently this can be achieved
by adding one more letter from the gene name to the symbol used in the
other species, <I>e.g.</I> <I>PC</I>, human, <I>Pcx</I>, mouse, pyruvate
decarboxylase. </P>
<P>Where possible the numbering of homologous loci in a series should be
made concordant in various species, with locus <I>1</I> in the mouse
corresponding to the locus <I>A</I> in other species, locus <I>2</I> with
locus <I>B</I>, and so on. </P>
<P>Do not insert the letter m or M (for mouse) as the first letter of the
symbol for a locus with homologues in other species. This would lead to all
mouse locus symbols beginning with the same letter. </P>
<B><P>Note: </B>To describe conservation between species, "synteny" should
not be used synonymously with "homology" because synteny means literally on
the same thread or chromosome. The appropriate phrases are "conserved
synteny" when a gene and its other species homolog are assigned to
homologous chromosomes in the mouse and the other species and "conserved
linkage" or "conserved segment" when the two genes are positionally mapped
within the same region on the two species' chromosomes. "Conserved ordered
segment" may be used when the order of genes within the segment is
conserved. (Note approved 11/95) </P>
<P><A NAME="Alleles">1.1.7. Alleles</A> </P>
<P>Alleles are usually designated by the locus symbol with an added
superscript (in italics when printed). In computerized symbols the
superscript may be denoted by prefixing an asterisk or enclosing the allele
symbol in angle brackets, <I>e.g.</I> <I>Gpi1<SUP>a</I></SUP> or <I>Gpi1*a
</I>or <I>Gpi1&lt;a&gt;</I>. Alleles for D symbol loci are described in
section 1.1.3. </P>
<P>When a spontaneous mutation is cloned or shown to occur in a previously
named candidate gene, the mutation's symbol is changed to become an allele
at the cloned locus by turning the mutation symbol into an allele symbol,
<I>e.g.</I> the <I>shi</I> (shiverer) mutation in the <I>Mbp</I> (myelin
basic protein) gene becomes <I>Mbp<SUP>shi</I></SUP>. If the original
mutation symbol already has a superscript, the mutation and allele symbols
are placed on one line in the new superscript and hyphenated, <I>e.g.</I>
the <I>shi<SUP>mld</I></SUP> (myelin deficient) mutation becomes
<I>Mbp<SUP>shi-mld</I></SUP> (see also #2 below). </P>
<P>1. In the case of mutant genes for which there is clearly a wild type
the symbol for the first discovered mutant allele becomes both the gene
symbol and the symbol for that allele. No superscript is then used,
<I>e.g.</I> <I>Hfh11<SUP>nu</I></SUP>, nude; <I>Ca</I>, caracul. When
further alleles are discovered, the first mutant allele may still be
without a superscript and allele symbols for new alleles are added as
superscripts, <I>e.g.</I> <I>Ca<SUP>J</I></SUP>, a remutation at the
caracul locus.</P>
<P>2. Recessive alleles should be indicated by the use of a lower case
initial letter for a mutant gene, <I>e.g.</I> <I>a</I>, nonagouti;
<I>Hfh11<SUP>nu</I></SUP>, nude, <I>gus<SUP>mps</I></SUP>,
mucopolysaccharidosis VII caused by a recessive mutation in the <I>Gus</I>
gene. All other alleles, whether dominant, codominant or having dominance
relationships that vary with method of assessment, should be indicated by
the use of a capital initial letter followed by lower case letters, as in
the locus symbol, <I>e.g.</I> <I>Re</I>, rex, <I>Ta</I>, tabby. </P>
<P>Two exceptions to this rule are allowed for targeted and cloned mutant
genes when the original cloned gene symbol starts with an upper case
letter: </P>
<P>(1) If the phenotype of mutant alleles may be recessive or codominant
depending on the method of determination, the use of upper or lower case
will depend upon what the naming investigator considers the defining
phenotype. For example, a <U>t</U>argeted <U>m</U>utant allele of
<I>Tcra</I> created by <U>M</U>ombaerts can be symbolized
<I>Tcra<SUP>tm1Mom</I></SUP>, even though heterozygotes are not visibly
different from wild type mice, if heterozygotes can be distinguished at the
DNA or protein level. </P>
<P>(2) When a mutation is shown to occur in a cloned candidate gene and its
symbol is changed to become an allele of the cloned gene (see first
paragraph of 1.1.7 above), the first letter of the gene symbol may remain
uppercase and the inheritance pattern may be conveyed in the allele symbol,
e.g. the <I>e</I> (recessive yellow) and <I>E<SUP>so</I></SUP> (somber)
alleles at the <I>Mc1r</I> (melanocortin 1 receptor) gene become
<I>Mc1r<SUP>e</I></SUP> and <I>Mc1r<SUP>E-so</I></SUP>. </P>
<P>3. Allele superscripts should typically be one or two lower case letters
and, if possible, should convey additional information about the allele,
<I>e.g.</I> <I>Tyr<SUP>c-ch</I></SUP>, chinchilla allele of
<I>Tyr<SUP>c</SUP> </I>or albino; <I>Mitf<SUP>Mi-wh</I></SUP>, white allele
at the microphthalmia locus. If information is too complex to be conveyed
conveniently in the symbol (<I>e.g.</I> biochemical properties, antigenic
specificities), the alleles are given superscripts and the information
concerning the allelic properties is shown in catalogues or tables,
<I>e.g.</I> <I>Pgm1<SUP>a</I></SUP>, <I>Pgm1<SUP>b</I></SUP>;
<I>H2<SUP>a</I></SUP>, <I>H2<SUP>b</I></SUP>, etc. In publications,
multipoint cross data may be displayed using single capital letters to
designate the two strains used in the cross (see section 1.1.7.9). </P>
<P>4. For alleles, particularly of loci concerned with viral expression or
with immune responses, where the allele designates presence or absence of a
virus or response, the following convention should be used. The allele for
the presence of the virus or immune response is designated by a superscript
<I>a</I> and the allele for absence of the trait by a superscript <I>b</I>.
In the case of loci governing resistance and susceptibility to infectious
organisms or other agents, resistance is designated by a superscript
<I>r</I> and susceptibility by a superscript <I>s</I>.</P>
<P>5. Wild type should be designated by a + sign, with the locus symbol as
superscript, <I>e.g.</I> +<I> <SUP>Myo5a-d</I></SUP>,
+<I><SUP>Tyr-c</I></SUP>. Reversions from a mutant allele to wild type
should be distinguished from the original wild type allele by designating
them by the locus symbol, with a + sign as superscript <I>e.g.</I>
<I>Myo5a<SUP>d-</I>+</SUP><I>, pe</I><SUP>+</SUP>. The + sign may be
followed by a number and letter to designate subsequent reversions at a
specific locus, <I>e.g.<BR>
Myo5a<SUP>d-+2J</I></SUP>, the second reversion at the dilute locus to
occur at The Jackson Laboratory. A + sign alone may be used when the
context leaves no doubt as to the locus represented, <I>e.g.</I> in genetic
formulae. </P>
<P>6. Indistinguishable alleles of independent origin (<I>e.g.</I>
reoccurrences, reversions to wild type) should be designated by the
existing gene symbol with a series symbol (see later) appended as a
superscript in italics. If the gene symbol already has a superscript, this
should be separated from the series symbol by a hyphen. The series symbol
should consist of an Arabic numeral corresponding to the serial number of
the variant in any given laboratory, plus an abbreviation indicating the
discoverer or laboratory of origin. When an investigator or laboratory
already has an assigned abbreviation for the designation of inbred
substrains or sublines, this should be used. Otherwise, the abbreviations
used should follow the rules for substrain designation and not duplicate an
existing symbol in the standard list of abbreviations. To avoid the
confusion of the numeral <I>1</I> and the letter <I>l</I>, a
first-discovered variant may be left unnumbered, and the second variant
numbered <I>2</I>. Examples: <I>Tyr<SUP>c-4Rl</I></SUP>, the fourth
reoccurrence of <I>Tyr<SUP>c</I></SUP> found by Russell;
<I>a<SUP>t-7J</I></SUP>, the seventh reoccurrence of <I>a<SUP>t</I></SUP>
found at The Jackson Laboratory; <I>Myo5a<SUP>d-+J</I></SUP> and
<I>Myo5a<SUP>d-+2J</I></SUP>, the first and second reversions from
<I>Myo5a<SUP>d</I></SUP> to <I>Myo5a<SUP>d</I>-+</SUP> found at The Jackson
Laboratory. </P>
<P>When two named mutant genes are found to be alleles at the same locus,
the symbol published or assigned first remains the locus symbol and the
symbol of the second gene is superscripted as an allele symbol for that
mutation, <I>e.g.</I> <I>hr<SUP>rh</I></SUP>, the rhino allele at
hairless.</P>
<P>7. Mutations or other variations occurring in known alleles may be
denoted by a superscript <I>m</I> followed by an appropriate series symbol
(as above) and separated from the original allele symbol, if one exists, by
a hyphen, <I>e.g.</I> <I>Mod1<SUP>a-m1Lws</I></SUP>, the first mutant
allele of <I>Mod1<SUP>a</I></SUP> found by Lewis. For known deletions of
all or part of an allele the superscript <I>m</I> may be replaced with
<I>dl</I>. Information on the allele of origin of mutations may be valuable
in elucidating changes in DNA sequence. Mutant alleles created by targeted
mutagenesis should have a <I>t</I> preceding the <I>m</I> to denote
<U>t</U>argeted, <I>e.g.</I> <I>Cftr<SUP>tm1Unc</I></SUP>, a
<U>t</U>argeted <U>m</U>utation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
regulator gene created at the <U>U</U>niversity of <U>N</U>orth
<U>C</U>arolina.</P>
<P>7a. When an existing gene is replaced with a different, functional gene,
called a "knock-in," the symbol shall be written as an allele of the
original gene. For example, if <I>Myf5</I> is deleted and replaced with
<I>Myod</I>, <I>Myf5Myod-labcode#</I> when there is a more-or-less complete
knock-in, or by <I>Myf5m-labcode#</I> when it is a domain swap of some
kind. The domain(s) swapped should be indicated by letters such as
P=promotor, E=enhancing element, E#, = exon #; e.g. <I>Myf5mP-labcode#</I>.
The labcode is an investigator or institution's Laboratory Registration
Code (used also for strain holders, DNA symbols, and targeted mutations)
and the # is a serial number for that laboratory.</P>
<P>8. Mutant alleles that turn out subsequently to be deletions retain
their allelic designation, <I>e.g.</I> <I>Ta<SUP>25H</I></SUP> and the
various <I>c</I>-locus deletions retain their original symbols even though
they are now known to be deletions that encompass more than the <I>Ta</I>
or <I>Tyr<SUP>c</I></SUP> loci. If the deletion deletes more than one gene
and is cytologically visible, the deletion should be given a chromosome
anomaly designation containing the original allele designation and the
allele symbol is used as the abbreviation. For example, <BR>
Del(10)<I>Mgf<SUP>Sl-12</I></SUP>1H is the first deletion discovered at
Harwell; it is located on Chromosome 10 and was originally detected as the
12th steel allele at Harwell (<I>Mgf<SUP>Sl-12H</I></SUP>). Once referred
to in a publication by the full designation, it may be abbreviated
<I>Mgf<SUP>Sl-12H</I></SUP>. Information on the genes deleted becomes part
of the description. If the deletion deletes more than one gene, but is not
cytologically detectable, the above nomenclature is discouraged, although a
cytological designation may be given in the future if improved techniques
reveal the deletion cytologically. The term "cytological" refers to cases
where the deletion can be detected by simple staining methods and visual
examination of chromosomes. For a deletion of multiple genes detected only
by methods such as <I>in situ</I> hybridization of gene-specific probes, it
is left to the investigator to determine the most useful terminology.</P>
<P>9. To display polymorphic data from a multipoint cross in a table for
publications it is acceptable to use single letter abbreviations for the
strains involved in the cross to designate the strain origin of the
alleles. A footnote to the table should point out that these designate
strain of origin rather than allele symbols, <I>e.g.</I> B for C57BL/6 vs.
S for <I>M. spretus</I>. In databases where single letters are needed to
make comparisons among strains, the letter used will refer to the
"haplotype" or constellation of different variants revealed by different
assays that make up the phenotype of a particular locus for a particular
strain. The first strain in which the "phenotype" is described is the
prototype and determines the allele symbol. If two strains thought to have
the same allele are distinguished from each other by a different assay, one
of them is given a new simple allele designation. Other strains with the
original allele designation, retain the original until they are typed with
the new assay to determine their appropriate allele designation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Lethals">1.1.8. Lethals</A> </P>
<P>Appropriate locus symbols for recessive lethals with no known
heterozygous effect and unidentified function consist of a lower case
letter <I>l</I> followed by the number of the chromosome on which the locus
is located in parentheses, and series symbol indicating the serial number
of the lethal in the laboratory of origin, <I>e.g.</I> <I>l(5)1Rk</I>, the
first lethal on Chr 5 found by Roderick; <I>l(17)2Pas</I>, the second
lethal on Chr 17 found at the Pasteur Institute. Such symbols should be
considered as provisional. The lethal should be renamed if found to be
allelic with a known gene, or if the underlying defect becomes understood.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Viruses">1.1.9. Viruses</A> </P>
<P>Nomenclature for genes related to the expression of viral antigens, or
to sensitivity or resistance to viruses, should follow the standard rules
for gene nomenclature; i.e. symbols should be italicized, with the initial
letter a capital and all others lower case. When possible and appropriate,
the letters of the symbol should be those by which the virus is usually
known; <I>e.g.</I> <I>Mtv1</I>, a locus concerned in induction of mammary
tumour virus, MTV. Successive loci concerned with the same virus should be
distinguished by appending serial numbers; <I>e.g.</I> <I>Fv1</I>,
<I>Fv2</I>, loci concerned with resistance to Friend virus.</P>
<P><A NAME="Oncogenes">1.1.10. Oncogenes</A> </P>
<P>Nomenclature for mouse cellular oncogene sequences should follow the
standard nomenclature for oncogenes. When referring specifically to the
mouse locus, however, in lists of symbols and maps, the prefix <I>c</I>-
denoting cellular sequence should be omitted and the initial letter of the
symbol should be capitalized; <I>e.g.</I> <I>c-myc</I> becomes <I>Myc</I>,
myelocytoma oncogene; <I>c-Hras1</I> becomes <I>Hras1</I>, Harvey rat
sarcoma-1 oncogene; <I>c-erba</I> becomes <I>Erba</I>, avian
erythroblastosis oncogene. </P>
<P>The names and symbols of oncogenes should be regarded as provisional
until the true functions of the genes become known, when they should be
renamed, <I>e.g.</I> <I>Erbb </I>becomes epidermal growth factor receptor,
<I>Egfr</I>; <I>Sis</I> becomes platelet derived growth factor, beta
polypeptide, <I>Pdgfb.</P>
</I><P><A NAME="Phenotype">1.1.11. Phenotype symbols</A> </P>
<P>Phenotype symbols, where these are necessary (<I>e.g.</I> antigen loci,
enzyme loci), should be the same as genotype symbols except that symbols
for phenotypes should be in capitals, not italicized, and with superscripts
lowered to the line. The phenotypes of heterozygotes should be written as
in the following example: GPI1A, GPI1B, and GPI1AB are phenotypes
associated with the <I>Gpi1</I> locus. </P>
<P>In those cases in which information concerning the subunit structure of
a protein is available, phenotype symbols for individual isozymes should
reflect the subunit composition when those isozymes are being discussed.
Where multiple loci exist for a single enzyme, locus <I>1</I> should be
considered to synthesize the A subunit, locus <I>2</I> the B subunit, etc.
Phenotypes are then designated according to the rules of the International
Union of Biochemistry (8), <I>e.g.</P>
</I><P>Locus Isozyme phenotype </P>
<I><P>Pgm1</I> PGMA </P>
<I><P>Pgm2</I> PGMB </P>
<I><P>Adh1</I> ADHA<SUB>2</SUB> </P>
<I><P>Adh2</I> ADHB<SUB>2</SUB> </P>
<I><P>Ldh1 </I>LDHA<SUB>4</SUB> </P>
<I><P>Gpi1</I> GPIA<SUB>2</P>
</SUB><P>When discussing the subunit structure of individual allozymes
found with allelic variants, the phenotype symbols should reflect the
subunit composition; i.e. allele <I>1<SUP>a</I></SUP> synthesizes the
A<SUP>a</SUP> subunit; allele <I>1<SUP>b</I></SUP> the A<SUP>b</SUP>
subunit, etc. Once the full phenotype designation is given, the allelic
variant symbols may be used alone to simplify presentation, <I>e.g.</P>
</I><P>Genotype Phenotype </P>
<I><P>Ldh1<SUP>a</I></SUP>/<I>Ldh1<SUP>a</I></SUP>

</SUB><P><A NAME="Complexes">1.1.12. Gene complexes</A> </P>
<P>Gene complexes are considered to exist when a number of apparently
functionally or evolutionarily related loci are genetically closely linked.
Alternative states of complexes are referred to as <I>haplotypes</I> rather
than alleles. </P>
<P>Known complexes are of two main types: (a) less extensive complexes
involving duplicate loci or in which operators or <I>cis</I>-acting
regulators of structural genes for protein show little or no recombination
with the loci on which they act: and (b) very extensive complexes, possibly
involving hundreds of related loci, for which special rules may be
necessary. The <I>H2</I> and the immunoglobin complexes are in category
(b).</P>
<I><P>Less extensive complexes involving operators, cis-acting regulators,
or duplicate loci</I> </P>
<P>This type of gene complex occurs most frequently for genes defined by
biochemical function, with structural and regulatory loci tightly linked.
Members of such complexes are typically designatedby adding a single lower
case letter separated from the gene symbol by a hyphen. See section 1.2.1
for detailed rules for symbols in this type of complex. </P>
<I><P>Very extensive complexes with special rules</I> </P>
<P>The list of extensive complexes with special rules continually
increases. The need for special rules for each arises because the various
complexes differ widely in their structure and no suitable single
nomenclature system has yet been found that is adequate for all these
complexes. Capitalized suffixes are sometimes used to denote regions of
complexes, <I>e.g.</I> -C and -V for the constant region and variable
region of the immunoglobulin complexes, respectively. </P>
<P>Some complexes with special rules include: </P>
<P>(a) <I>H2</I> complex (see 2.3); </P>
<P>(b) immunoglobulin complexes (see 1.2.5); </P>
<P>(c) globin gene complexes (see 1.2.4); </P>
<P>(d) homeobox-containing gene complexes (see 1.2.6); </P>
<P>(e) <I>t</I>-complex. </P>
<P>Rules for specific complexes are given briefly in Section 1.2 with
references, whenever they exist, to publications focusing on the specific
complexes.</P>
<P><A NAME="Mitochondrial">1.1.13. Mitochondrial genome</A> </P>
<P>Loci in the mitochondrial genome should be denoted by the prefix
<I>mt</I>- set off from the main symbol by a hyphen. </P>
<P><A NAME="Variants">1.1.14. Antigenic variants</A> </P>
<P>Symbols adopted for loci concerned in cell-membrane alloantigens should
be based on the method of demonstrating such loci. Brief examples of the
different types are listed below with reference to the sections in which
detailed rules, if they exist, can be found.</P>
<P>1. Loci primarily demonstrable by transplantation techniques should be
designated by an initial <I>H</I>; <I>e.g.</I> <I>H1</I>, <I>H2</I>, etc.
(see 1.2.3). </P>
<P>2. Loci demonstrable by red-cell agglutination should be designated by
the letters <I>Ea</I>; <I>e.g.</I> <I>Ea1</I>, <I>Ea2</I>, etc.</P>
<P>3. Loci coding for a cell surface molecule on lymphocytes, or shared by
lymphocytes and other cell types, and detected by serological or
biochemical methods, and for which there is a demonstrable polymorphism,
should be designated by the letters <I>Cd</I>, if the CD antigen is known,
and <I>Ly</I>, if not (see 1.2.2).</P>
<P>4. Similarly, other antigen loci involving other cell types should be
denoted by symbols indicating the cell type, <I>e.g.</I> <I>Pca</I>, plasma
cell antigen; <I>Tla</I>, thymus leukaemia antigen.</P>
<P><A NAME="Special">1.2. Nomenclature for special classes of genes and
gene complexes</A> </P>
<P><A NAME="Biochemical">1.2.1. Guidelines for nomenclature of biochemical
variants</A> </P>
<I><P>Biochemical nomenclature</I> should be in accord with the rules of
the International Union of Biochemistry, Commission on Biochemical
Nomenclature. The nomenclature recommended by the Commission is published
periodically in major international biochemical journals, such as the
<I>Journal of Biolo</I>g<I>ical Chemistry</I> and the <I>Biochemical
Journal</I>. Enzymes and other biochemicals have both trivial and formal
names. The correct formal name should be given the first time a substance
is mentioned in a publication; trivial or abbreviated names can be used
subsequently. Example: G6PD, GPD, or Gd, abbreviations of
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (E.C. 1.1.1.49; D-glucose
6-phosphate:NADP oxidoreductase). This nomenclature is used in periodicals,
reference works, and textbooks of biochemistry. </P>
<I><P>Symbols of structural loci</I> should typically be two-, three- or
four-letter abbreviations (italic type) of the official Commission name of
the enzyme, protein, or other substance affected. The initial letter of the
symbol should be capitalized. Example: <I>Gpi1</I>, the first identified
structural locus of glucosephosphate isomerase (E.C. 5.3.1.9; D-glucose
6-phosphate ketol-isomerase). In the case of biochemical variants, the use
of the locus symbol with a lower case initial letter to indicate recessive
mutant genes and with a capital initial letter to indicate dominant mutant genes should generally be avoided. Such nomenclature is not suited to polymorphi
c systems of alleles, and the dominance-recessive relationship usually
varies and depends on the method used to assess it. The symbol may begin
with a lower case letter when a rare mutation (as opposed to a variant) in
a biochemical gene causes a visibly mutant phenotype, <I>e.g.</I>
<I>gus<SUP>mps</I></SUP> causing mucopolysaccharidosis. </P>
<P>Greek letters preceding the name of an enzyme or other protein, should
be changed to an appropriate English letter and placed at the end of the
locus symbol; <I>e.g.</I> <I>Fuca</I>, <FONT
FACE="Symbol">a</FONT>-fucosidase. This permits the assignment of stem or
root symbols for related loci and a rational alphabetic ordering of locus
symbols. </P>
<P>Similarly, adjectives describing the tissue specificity or other
property of an enzyme or protein should normally be placed after the noun,
again in order to allow appropriate alphabetic ordering of symbols,
<I>e.g.</I> <I>Actc</I>, actin, cardiac; <I>Acts</I>, actin, skeletal. </P>
<I><P>A series of loci specifying the structure of isoenzymes</I> that
catalyze the same or similar reactions but are structurally different, or
the different polypeptide chains of a protein, can be designated by the
same letter symbol for the structural locus with the addition of a
distinguishing number. Example: <I>Pgm1</I> and <I>Pgm2</I>, loci of
structurally different isoenzymes of phosphoglucomutase (E.C. 2.7.5.1;
phosphotransferase). </P>
<I><P>Alleles</I> for biochemical loci should be designated by the locus
symbol with an added superscript as in the standard rules. In describing
alleles, whether found in inbred strains or in the wild, it is desirable
that the phenotype of a number of widely used inbred strains be reported.
One strain should arbitrarily be designated the prototype strain for each
allele, since variation that has not been detected by the methods used may
be present within each allelic class. If an apparently identical allele in
other strains is found by new methods to be different from that in the
prototype strain, it should be assigned a new alphabetical symbol as a
superscript and a prototype strain designated. This system permits the
orderly assignment of symbols to newly identified alleles and allows ready
comparisons of new variants with previously reported variants. </P>
<P>Locus and allele symbols are necessarily brief and cannot contain more
than a small fraction of the known information. Additional information may
be contained in gene descriptions which in some cases can be collected in
catalogues or tables. The haemoglobin a-chain locus <I>Hba</I>, for
example, specifies at least four different polypeptides, with the
additional complication that in some strains two different polypeptides are
both produced. The alleles can be assigned letter designations, and
information about the amino acid composition of the chains produced by the
alleles can be shown in tables. This is somewhat similar to the method
already in use to record the specificities determined by alleles at loci
for antigenic variants. </P>
<I><P>Proteins detected as spots on 2 D-gels but not identified. </I>Locus
symbols for proteins detected as spots on 2D-gels should only be given if
genetic variation or gene location is established, the gene behaves in a
Mendelian fashion, and as far as possible, the protein is known to be
distinct from those already named. Such genes, proved by genetic variation,
should be given provisional symbols until the function of the protein in
the spot is known. When the protein is identified the locus should be given
a new and appropriate symbol. </P>
<I><P>Phenotype </I>symbols for biochemical loci, where these are
necessary, should be the same as genotype symbols, except that symbols for
phenotypes should be in capitals, not italicized, and with superscripts
lowered to the line. Example: GPI1A, GPI1B, phenotypes associated with the
<I>Gpi1</I> locus. In those cases in which information concerning subunit
structure is available and isozyme and allozyme structure is being
discussed, phenotype symbols should reflect the subunit composition,
according to the rules of the International Union of Biochemistry (8) by
use of capital letters. Details are given in Rules for gene nomenclature
(Section 1.1.11). </P>
<I><P>Identification of loci</I> defined by biochemical function should not
be assumed from the discovery of phenotypic structural variation; crosses
should be made to show Mendelian segregation of the alleles or a defined
map position of the locus. Official gene symbols should not be assigned to
variants found in wild mice unless appropriate genetic tests for allelism
with known similar variants are carried out. In the absence of genetic
tests, phenotypic symbols (as in the standard rules) should be used,
together with a description of the criteria used to establish identity with
phenotypes of inbred strains. </P>
<I><P>Genetic variants affecting enzyme activity</I> may do so for reasons
other than a direct change in the catalytic activity per molecule of the
enzyme under study. Presumptive mutations in this group include those
producing activity differences with no discernible alteration in physical
or chemical properties of the enzyme and those producing tissue-specific
differences in activity. Mutations producing this type of quantitative
variation may or may not prove to be allelic or forming a gene complex with
the structural locus of the enzyme in question. When allelic with the
structural locus, they should be so designated following the standard
rules. When not allelic or when the structural locus has not been
identified, the new locus should be named on the basis of its discernible
phenotype, following the above rules. Examples: <I>Lv</I>, levulinate
dehydratase, a locus affecting the amount of enzyme present; <I>Ahr</I>,
aromatic hydrocarbon responsiveness, a locus affecting the level of
hydroxylase induced by aromatic hydrocarbons. </P>
<I><P>Homology with other organisms. </I>As for other homologous loci, when
choosing a gene symbol an attempt should first be made to discover and use
any symbols already adopted for this locus in other species. Remember,
however, care should be taken that such symbols <I>do not duplicate any
already in use in the mouse</I> for other loci. Where possible the
numbering of homologous loci in a series should be made concordant in
various species. If the human or other species symbol uses serial letters,
use <I>1</I> in the mouse to correspond to the locus <I>A</I> in another
species, locus<I> 2</I> for locus <I>B</I>, and so on.</P>
<I><P>Complexes involving operators, cis-acting regulators, or duplicate
loci</I> </P>
<P>The existence of a gene complex, rather than multiple types of variation
in a structural gene, should not be postulated unless there is good
evidence. It should be remembered that different mutations in a structural
gene may affect not only electrophoretic mobility but also activity and
stability. In addition, changes in 5' or 3' regulatory sequences may cause
apparent changes in tissue specificity or inducibility. Thus, such changes
in effect should be attributed to mutations in the structural gene unless
the "regulatory gene" has recombined with the structural gene in a linkage
cross or between different inbred strains. </P>
<P>To distinguish different loci of the complex, the basic symbol should
have appended a single lower case letter designating the presumed function
or means of identification of the locus, such as <I>s</I> (structural),
<I>e</I> (electrophoretic), <I>r</I> (regulatory), or <I>t</I> (temporal).
This letter should be set off by a hyphen, as in <I>Bgl-e</I>
(beta-galactosidase electrophoretic) or <I>Adh3-t</I> (alcohol
dehydrogenase-3 temporal). When it is discovered that a previously
described locus is part of a complex, a letter indicative of its function
or means of identification should be added to the basic symbol to represent
the already known locus, as well as a different letter for the newly
discovered locus. An example is the <I>Adh3</I> locus, after discovery of a
temporal regulator, becomes <I>Adh3e </I>(<I>Adh3</I> electrophoretic) and
the regulator is called <I>Adh3t</I> (<I>Adh3</I> temporal). The basic
symbol (e.g. <I>Adh3</I>) then represents the entire complex; if necessary
for clarity, the complex may be additionally indicated by enclosing the
basic symbol in parenthesis or in brackets. Haplotypes are designated by
the symbol for the complex with a superscript small letter. The components
of the haplotype can be briefly indicated as in the following example:
<I>Adh3<SUP>a</I></SUP> or (<I>Adh3</I>)<I><SUP>a</I></SUP> =
<I>Adh3e<SUP>a</SUP> Adh3t<SUP>a</I></SUP> =
<I>Adh3e<SUP>a</SUP>t<SUP>a</I></SUP>. In the case where two or more
closely linked and functionally or evolutionarily related structural loci
have been given serial numbers, the complex, loci, and haplotypes should be
indicated as in the following example: complex, <I>Amy</I> or (<I>Amy</I>);
loci, <I>Amy1</I>, <I>Amy2</I>; haplotypes, <I>Amy<SUP>a</I></SUP> or
(<I>Amy</I>)<I><SUP>a</I></SUP> = <I>Amy1<SUP>a</I></SUP>
<I>Amy2<SUP>a</I></SUP> = <I>Amy1<SUP>a</SUP>2<SUP>a</I></SUP>. </P>
<P>Distantly acting regulators should be given locus symbols different from
but related to the locus they regulate and preferably with the same initial
letter, for example, <I>Ldr</I> (a regulator of the lactate dehydrogenase
locus <I>Ldh</I>).</P>
<P>Suffixes so far used, either for loci in gene complexes, or for
subdividing series of loci, include</P>
<P>-e Electrophoretic, </P>
<P>-m Mitochondrial, </P>
<P>-r Regulatory, </P>
<P>-s Structural, </P>
<P>-t Temporal.</P>
<P><A NAME="Controlling">1.2.2. Nomenclature for loci controlling mouse
lymphocyte antigens</A> </P>
<P>Research into mouse lymphocyte antigens has been very active, with many
new loci and alleles being named. This rapid accumulation of new data has
led, unfortunately, to considerable confusion in the nomenclature, with
duplication of Ly numbers, and allocation of different names for the same
antigen. A small group of workers in the field met in 1987 to draft a
revised nomenclature as a means of overcoming the various problems and to
establish a central registry (15). In 1992 a decison was made to use
cluster determinant (CD) nomenclature for lymphocyte antigens whenever the
CD protein or human CD homologue is known. The designation <I>Cd</I> is
allocated to a gene shown by biochemical or molecular genetic techniques to
be the mouse homolog of a human gene that encodes a molecule present on
elements of the hemopoietic system and that has been given a CD
designation. <I>Cd</I> genes will be numbered according to human CD
designation, with the number not separated from <I>Cd</I> by a hyphen,
<I>e.g.</I>, <I>Cd5</I> is the designation for the gene (previously
designated <I>Ly1</I>) that encodes the murine equivalent of the human CD5
antigen. <I>Ly</I> symbols will still be assigned for <I>Ly </I>type loci
for which the CD antigen is not known; such symbols will be changed to<I>
Cd# </I>symbols when the CD protein is identified. The conversion of
previous <I>Ly</I> symbols to <I>Cd</I> symbols is published in Morse, 1992
(14).</P>
<I><P>Ly nomenclature registry</I> </P>
<P>The registry has been established at the National Institutes of Health
and will be administered by H.C. Morse III. <I>Cd</I> numbers will be
assigned to loci for CD antigens. New <I>Ly</I> gene numbers for genes
whose CD homolog is not known, will be allocated in order of receipt of
requests, which should be accompanied by a copy of the evidence
demonstrating a new <I>Cd</I> or <I>Ly </I>locus. All applications should
be addressed to Dr. H.C. Morse III, Laboratory of Immunopathology, National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Building 7, Room 304,
National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.</P>
<I><P>Definition of an Ly locus</I> </P>
<P>The designation <I>"Ly"</I> (italicized) should be given to a gene
coding for a cell surface molecule on lymphocytes, or shared by lymphocytes
and other cell types, when the CD antigen designation is not known. The
antigenic molecule is designated by the same symbol unitalicized (LY or
CD). The criteria for recognizing such genes have been broadened
considerably since the first <I>Ly</I> loci were described, in order to
accommodate new information obtained from major technical advances, such as
molecular genetic techniques, which have led to the identification of new
loci for lymphocyte surface antigens. In particular, (a) somatic cell
hybridization techniques have led to the mapping of several loci not
exhibiting genetic polymorphism, and must be considered with conventional
segregation analysis to identify and map genes; (b) biochemical techniques
not involving the use of antibody can be used to identify cell-surface
molecules; (c) molecular cloning can be used to identify <I>Ly</I> genes
not showing genetic polymorphism; and (d) genes can be identified by use of
cDNA probes from other species. Genes for which no cell membrane molecule
has been found in the mouse can be isolated by this technique using cDNA
probes for genes encoding membrane molecules identified in other species.
These genes should be designated by the mouse equivalent of the symbol in
the other species. </P>
<P>It should be noted that these criteria do not distinguish between loci
expressed only on lymphocytes, <I>e.g.</I> <I>Cd5</I>, <I>Cd8a</I> and
<I>Ly7</I>, and those shared with other cell types, <I>e.g.</I> <I>Cd45</I>
and <I>Ly6</I>. It is not practical to make this distinction, as experience
has taught us that, with time and more extensive tissue distribution
analysis, many molecules have a wider tissue distribution than first
reported.</P>
<I><P>Specificities and alleles</I> </P>
<P>Alleles are designated with lower case letter superscripts and
specificities with Arabic numerals separated from the antigen symbol by a
period. The allelic superscript <I>a</I> is used for specificity
<I>e.g.</I>, .1, <I>b</I> is used for specificity .2, etc. The uniform
practice of designating the C57BL/6 allele with the superscript <I>b</I>
and specificity with the number .2 is recommended, <I>e.g.</I>, for
<I>Cd5</I>, C57BL/6 mice have the allele <I>Cd5<SUP>b</I></SUP> and the
specificity CD5<I>.2</I>. This convention requires a change of two alleles
and specificities, for the <I>Ly5</I> and <I>Ly7</I> loci.</P>
<I><P>Monoclonal antibodies</I> </P>
<P>Since the advent of monoclonal antibodies, it is possible to produce
many different antibodies recognizing the same molecule, including
antibodies detecting different epitopes present on one molecule. In the
absence of any co-ordinated effort to determine if such epitope differences
have any significance in terms of function or differentiation, we do not
consider it necessary to distinguish between specificities defined by
independently derived monoclonal antibodies. However, where possible, a
monoclonal antibody should be used to define an antigen. Some <I>Ly</I>
antigens defined by monoclonal antibodies have been designated <I>Lym</I>,
<I>e.g.</I> <I>Lym10</I>. Since the vast majority of antigens are now
defined by monoclonal antibodies, the "m" should no longer be used. Thus
<I>Lym10</I> is now <I>Ly10</I>.</P>
<I><P>Xenogeneic antibodies</I> </P>
<P>Lymphocyte antigens can often be detected by xenogeneic antibodies. In
some cases, these antibodies can distinguish between specificities
determined by different alleles at the particular locus; in others, they
react equally well with all specificities. In the latter case, <I>e.g.</I>
with an antibody recognizing the <I>Cd5</I> antigen, the antigenic
determinant recognized by the antibody is not assigned a specificity
number, but can be referred to as a "framework" determinant or as a
molecule carrying the <I>Cd5</I> specificity.</P>
<I><P>Requirements for designating a new Ly or Cd locus</I> </P>
<P>A cell-surface molecule must be identified and shown to be present on
lymphocytes or identified as a homologue of a CD locus in another species.
The molecule will usually be identified by serological methods, preferably
by a monoclonal antibody, often combined with biochemical characterization.
</P>
<P>Evidence for genetic control of the molecule must be shown. If genetic
variation is found, crosses should be made to show that the variation is
controlled by a single gene and, if possible, to find the chromosomal
location of the gene. A unique strain distribution of the alleles or a
unique chromosomal location can be taken as evidence for a new <I>Cd</I> or
<I>Ly</I> locus. If variation in the antigen is not found, it may be
possible to identify the gene controlling the antigen by somatic cell
hybridization, by molecular cloning, or by discovery of other variation in
the gene such as a restriction fragment length polymorphism. </P>
<P>If the presumed new locus shows no recombination with a previously known
locus, it should not be given a new locus symbol until more definitive
evidence is available that the two genes are indeed distinct. Such evidence
may include different tissue distributions or different molecular weights.
Neither are entirely reliable, however, since apparently different tissue
distributions may result from use of different antibodies or different
methods of quantifying presence of the antigen, and different molecular
weights may result from posttranslational modifications of the antigen.</P>
<I><P>Rationalization of existing nomenclature</I> </P>
<P>To remove duplications and various other ambiguities some existing
nomenclature has been changed. For a comparison of old and new nomenclature
please see Morse (14). The following points should be noted:</P>
<P>1. In the course of eliminating duplications etc., some loci have been
renumbered.</P>
<P>2. The <I>Lyt</I> designation has been abandoned, but <I>Lyb3</I> to
<I>Lyb8</I> remain unchanged; <I>Lyb2</I> is now <I>Cd72</I>. </P>
<P>3. Various loci already well known by non-conforming names have been
left unchanged to avoid confusion. These include <I>Thy1, Thy2,</I> and
<I>Lna1</I>. However, it is recommended that, if similar loci are described
in the future, they should receive an <I>Ly</I> or <I>Cd</I> number. </P>
<P><A NAME="Histocompatibility">1.2.3. Nomenclature for histocompatibility
locus complexes</A> </P>
<I><P>The major histocompatibility 2 or H2 complex</I> </P>
<P>Genetic nomenclature for the <I>H2</I> complex has been revised several
times as knowledge of the <I>H2</I> complex has increased (9, 11, 19). A
major revision was undertaken by a special committee in 1990, and these
nomenclature rules in Klein <I>et al.</I> (10) should be followed. </P>
<P>Symbols for haplotypes for the <I>H2</I> complex should be superscripts,
consisting of small letters and Arabic numerals, assigned according to the
standing rules for the <I>H2</I> complex (10), such as
<I>H2<SUP>b</I></SUP>, <I>H2<SUP>bm1</I></SUP>, <I>H2<SUP>ap4</I></SUP>.
Previously, parts of the complex that were shown to be separable from each
other by recombination were referred to as <I>regions</I>, which might
consist of many loci. The regions were denoted by capital letters,
<I>e.g.</I>, <I>K</I>, <I>I</I>, <I>S</I>, and <I>D</I>. In referring to
alternative state or "alleles" of particular regions, the symbol of the
region was appended by a superscript denoting the haplotype from which the
region originated, for example <I>K<SUP>k</I></SUP>, <I>S<SUP>d</I></SUP>,
<I>D<SUP>b</I></SUP>. In the most recent <I>H2</I> nomenclature revision
(10), the term "region" has been dropped, because most individual loci are
now separable by recombination and the "region" concept is no longer
needed. New <I>H2</I> loci should be designated by symbols based on their
evolutionary relationships. Symbols should be chosen according to the valid
"Rules for gene nomenclature in mice" and the rules for the nomenclature of
the <I>H2</I> gene complex (10). Locus or subcomponents of the <I>H2</I>
complex are separated from <I>H2</I> by a hyphen. New class I loci are
designated by the "family" symbol and a number, <I>e.g.</I> <I>H2-K2,</I>
<I>H2-LM1</I>. Class II loci are designated by capital and lower case
letters, <I>e.g.</I> <I>H2-Aa</I>, <I>H2-Ab</I>, <I>H2-Ea</I>,
<I>H2-Eb</I>. Additional loci should be numbered, <I>e.g.</I>
<I>H2-Ab2</I>. The allelic forms of these loci are designated by
superscript letters denoting the haplotype of origin, for example,
<I>H2-K<SUP>b</I></SUP>, <I>C4<SUP>d</I></SUP>. <I>Only</I> when the
context precludes confusion with non <I>H2</I> symbols, may the designation
of <I>H2</I> regions or loci be used without the <I>H2</I> prefix. Rules
for nomenclature of mutant haplotypes were summarized by Kohn <I>et al</I>.
(11) and by Shreffler (20). Detailed information on <I>H2</I> nomenclature
may be found in Klein et al. (10).</P>
<I><P>Minor histocompatibility loci</I> </P>
<P>Minor histocompatibility loci outside the <I>H2</I> complex are
designated by H and serial numbers, <I>e.g.</I> <I>H1</I>, <I>H3</I>, etc.
These loci were originally defined by tissue rejection in congenic strains
containing transferred segments of chromosomes. With molecular methods,
some of these segments can now be shown to contain more than one gene, not
necessarily in a tightly linked complex. When a minor histocompatibility
phenotype is shown to result from more than one locus, letters in
alphabetical order are added to the symbol for the original locus,
<I>e.g.</I> two genes that contribute to the phenotype originally called
<I>H3</I> on Chromosome 2 are now designated <I>H3a</I> and <I>H3b
(17)</I>. </P>
<P><A NAME="Globin">1.2.4. Mouse globin gene nomenclature</A> </P>
<P>A meeting to discuss mouse globin gene nomenclature, organized by Dr.
Jane Barker, was held at Bar Harbor in May 1984. </P>
<P>The need for revision of the nomenclature had arisen largely as a result
of increasing knowledge of the <FONT FACE="Symbol">a</FONT><I>- </I>and
<FONT FACE="Symbol">b</FONT>-globin gene complexes, and also to obtain a
consistent nomenclature of spontaneous or induced mutations or other
variants of already known alleles or haplotypes. </P>
<P>The aim was to devise a system which would as far as possible be
consistent with other mouse genetic nomenclature, and nomenclature used for
globin genes in other species, and which would be practicable for use with
the types of genetic variation found in the mouse. </P>
<P>The following is an extract from the guidelines published more fully
elsewhere (12, 16). </P>
<P>The proposed system of nomenclature is as follows. </P>
<I><P>Gene complexes</I> </P>
<P>The <FONT FACE="Symbol">a</FONT><I>-</I> and <FONT
FACE="Symbol">b</FONT>-globin genes should be considered as constituting
gene complexes and should be given the names and
symbols--haemoglobin-alpha, <I>Hba</I> and haemoglobin-beta, <I>Hbb</P>
<P>Haplotypes</I> </P>
<P>The different forms of the complexes should be considered as haplotypes,
and designated by superscript lower case letters, <I>e.g.</I>
<I>Hba<SUP>a</SUP>, Hba<SUP>b</SUP>, Hbb<SUP>d</SUP>, Hbb<SUP>s</I></SUP>.
</P>
<P>The letters <I>m</I> and <I>o</I> should be omitted as they might be
confused with "mutant" or "null", and the letter <I>w</I> should be
reserved for wild-derived haplotypes. </P>
<P>If the alphabet becomes exhausted then a series of two-letter symbols
should be used, beginning <I>aa, ab</I>, etc. </P>
<I><P>Loci within complexes</I> </P>
<P>The individual gene loci within the <I>Hba</I> and <I>Hbb</I> complexes
should be denoted by lower case letters, in some cases followed by numbers
and set off from the main (complex) symbol by a hyphen, <I>e.g.</I>
<I>Hba-x</I> (previously <I>Hbx</I>) and <I>Hbb-y</I> (previously
<I>Hbby</I>). The numbers should run from the 5' end (in contrast to
comparable genes in man, but in line with previous numbering for the
mouse). </P>
<I><P>Alleles</I> </P>
<P>The alleles of genes within the complexes should be denoted by
superscript lower case letters, indicating the haplotype of origin,
<I>e.g.</I> <I>Hbb-y<SUP>s</I></SUP>,<I> Hbb-y<SUP>d</I></SUP>, the alleles
of <I>Hbb-y</I> occurring in haplotypes <I>Hbb<SUP>s</I></SUP> and
<I>Hbb<SUP>d</I></SUP>. </P>
<I><P>Variant haplotypes and alleles</I> </P>
<P>When new haplotypes or alleles arise by mutation or other changes in
already known haplotypes the new haplotype or allele should be denoted by
appending a serial number to the haplotype superscript. If the change is
known to be due to a mutation or deletion within a particular allele(s)
this should be indicated by adding an appropriate letter symbol and serial
number to the allele superscript, set off by a hyphen, <I>e.g.</I>
<I>Hbb<SUP>d2</SUP>, Hbb<SUP>d3</I></SUP>, the first two variants of the
haplotype <I>Hbb<SUP>d</SUP>; Hbb-b1<SUP>d-m1</I></SUP>, the first mutant
allele of the gene <I>Hbb-b1<SUP>d</SUP>; Hbb-b1<SUP>d-dl1</I></SUP>, the
first deletion found in the allele <I>Hbb-b1<SUP>d</I></SUP>. Note that
<I>Hbb</I> and <I>Hba</I> deletions may also use the allele symbol
<I>th</I> for thalassemia with a series number. These allele symbols are
also assigned by the Registry.</P>
<I><P>Globin gene registry</I> </P>
<P>In order to maintain an orderly sequence of designation of letters and
serial numbers to newly discovered and variant haplotypes and alleles it is
proposed that there should be a Mouse Globin Gene Registry. Dr. Ray Popp
has agreed to be the keeper of the Registry. To register new haplotypes or
alleles write to Dr. R.A. Popp, Biology Division, Oak Ridge National
Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37830, USA with details of the new variant.
Appropriate letters and/or numbers can then be assigned without duplication
or confusion. </P>
<P><A NAME="Immunoglobulin">1.2.5. Nomenclature for immunoglobulin</A>
complexes </P>
<I><P>The immunoglobulin complexes</I>. The heavy-, kappa-, and
lambda-chain regions are designated <I>Igh</I>, <I>Igk</I>, and <I>Igl</I>,
respectively. Haplotypes are designated by the symbol for the region with a
superscript lower case letter. The constant subregions are designated
<I>Igh-C</I>, <I>Igk-C</I>, and <I>Igl-C</I>, and individual loci in these
subregions are designated by Arabic numbers following the hyphen and
assigned chronologically, for example, <I>Igh-1</I>, <I>Igh-2</I>, etc,
<I>Igl-1</I>. Allelic symbols are superscript lower case letters denoting
the haplotype, or one of the haplotypes, in which the allele occurs. The
variable subregions are designated <I>Igh-V</I>, <I>Igk-V</I>, and
<I>Igl-V</I>, and individual loci in these subregions are designated by a
two- or three-letter symbol or by two letters and a number following the
hyphen, for example, <I>Igh-Dex</I>, <I>Igh-Pc</I>, <I>Igk-Ef1</I>. The
symbol following the hyphen for the variable-region loci should be related
to the antigen for which the immunoglobulin is specific or to the method
used for recognizing the variant. Allelic symbols are superscript lower
case letters such as: <I>a</I> and <I>b</I> in the case where allelic
markers are well established, for example, <I>Igk-Ef1<SUP>a</I></SUP> and
<I>Igk-Ef1<SUP>b</I></SUP> or <I>a</I> and <I>o</I> in the case where the
allelic nature of markers is in doubt and the alleles are postulated to
determine a marker and its absence, for example, <I>Igh-Dex<SUP>a</I></SUP>
and <I>Igh-Dex<SUP>o</I></SUP>. These rules are given in greater detail by
Green (6). </P>
<P>NOTE: Revision of rules for immunoglobulin complexes is in progress; in
the future, please consult the chairman of the International Nomenclature
Committee or the Mouse Genome Database at The Jackson Laboratory to assign
new gene symbols.</P>
<P><A NAME="Homeobox">1.2.6. Nomenclature for homeobox-containing genes</A>
</P>
<P>Recommendations on nomenclature for homeobox-containing genes were
published in 1987 (13) and later revised for homeobox genes in all species;
present rules and the rationale behind them were agreed to in 1992 (18).
This latter paper also contains a conversion chart of all previous symbols.
</P>
<P>Homeobox genes are genes that share a conserved homeodomain with
<I>Drosophila</I> homeotic genes. The symbol <I>Hox</I> is reserved for
genes whose homeobox is homologous to <I>Drosophila</I> <I>Antennapedia</I>
(ANTP) and <I>bithorax</I> (BX) complex genes. <I>Hox</I> gene complexes
are designated by sequential letters following the <I>Hox</I> symbol and
loci within each complex are designated by adding numbers to the complex
symbol, numbering serially from the 3' to 5' ends of the complex. The 4
<I>Hox</I> complexes known to exist in mice are clearly defined (18) and
new loci should not be assigned <I>Hox</I> symbols unless they are within
one of these complexes or clearly homologous to loci within the Drosophila
ANTP or BX clusters. </P>
<P>The criterion for designating a new <I>Hox</I> locus is that it occupies
a different map position (that is, it is physically distinct) from all
other known <I>Hox</I> loci. Until this criterion is met, a new
homeobox-containing gene or genomic sequence should be designated by a
"laboratory" name or a provisional symbol. The designation of any new
<I>Hox</I> locus or group of loci (complex), will be determined as follows:
(a) If it is not apparently closely linked to any previously described
<I>Hox</I> locus, it should be given the next the next available letter in
the series (<I>Hoxa, Hoxb, Hoxc</I>, and <I>Hoxd</I> have already been used
to designate <I>Hox</I> complexes). If two or more homeobox-containing loci
are present within a complex, these will be designated by numbers as stated
above (for example, <I>Hoxa1, Hoxa2</I>). These number designations should,
where possible, reflect the linear order of the <I>Hox</I> loci along the
chromosome from 3' to 5' ends of the complex; (b) If the new gene is known
to be closely linked to a previously designated <I>Hox</I> locus, it will
be given the letter designation of that locus or complex, and the next
available numerical designation in the series. Whenever possible, this
should reflect the linear order of the <I>Hox</I> loci along the
chromosome; (c) Before any new <I>Hox</I> designation is used in a
publication, authors should contact the Mouse Genome Database at The
Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine 04609, USA, or the editor of <I>Mouse
Genome </I>at the MRC Radiobiology Unit, Chilton, Didcot, Oxon OX11 0RD,
UK, to ensure that this designation has not already been assigned. </P>
<P>In general, locus symbols for other homeobox genes should begin with the
first two letters of the <I>Drosophila</I> gene or gene family with an
"<I>x</I>" appended. For example, the vertebrate <I>Pax</I> genes are most
closely related to the <I>Drosophila <U>pa</U>ired</I> gene and the
vertebrate <I>Msx</I> genes are most closely related to the <I>Drosophila
msh</I> gene. </P>
<P><A NAME="Transgenes">1.3. Rules for Naming Transgenes</A> </P>
<P>All DNA sequences that are experimentally and stably introduced into the
germline of animals are considered transgenes. They are named according to
the following conventions, which were developed by an interspecies
committee sponsored by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources (ILAR)
in 1992 (7). Transgenic symbols can be registered in the transgenic
database at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. </P>
<P>1. The transgene symbol consists of three parts, all in Roman typeface,
as follows:</P>
<P>TgX(YYYYYY)#####Zzz </P>
<P>Where TgX = Mode </P>
<P>(YYYYYY) = Insert designation </P>
<P>##### = Laboratory assigned number and </P>
<P>Zzz = Laboratory registration code</P>
<P>A. The mode, designates the transgene and always consists of the letters
"Tg" followed by a letter designating the mode of insertion of the DNA: H
for homologous recombination, R for insertion via infection with a
retroviral vector, and N for nonhomologous insertion. "Knockout" or
directed mutation of a specific known gene should be designated using
standard allele symbol conventions, <I>e.g.</I>
<I>Cftr<SUP>tm1Unc</I></SUP>, the first cystic fibrosis gene knockout at
the University of North Carolina (see 1.1.7.7). Transgenic nomenclature is
used for homologous recombination insertions when homologous recombination
is used as a mechanism to insert a transgene and it is the transgene itself
that is of primary interest. The purpose of this designation is to enable
the user to identify it as a symbol for a transgene and to distinguish
between the three fundamentally different organizations of the introduced
sequence relative to the host genome, not simply to indicate the method of
insertion or nature of the vector. To illustrate these distinctions
examples are given below.</P>
<P>Mice derived by infection of embryos with MuLV vectors are designated
TgR; mice derived by microinjection of MuLV DNA into zygotes are designated
TgN. </P>
<P>Mice derived from ES cells by introduction of DNA followed by
recombination with the homologous genomic sequence are designated TgH; mice
derived by random insertion of the same sequence by nonhomologous crossing
over events are designated TgN.</P>
<P>B. The insert designation is a symbol for the salient features of the
transgene, as determined by the investigator. It is always contained within
parentheses and consists of no more than 6 characters: letters (capitals or
capitals and lowercase letters) or a combination of letters and numbers.
Insert designations longer than 6 characters may be used <I>only</I> if the
insert designation and the laboratory assigned number (C. a. below)
together are 11 characters or less. Italics, super- or subscripts, internal
spaces, and punctuation should not be used, except hyphens used to separate
two parts of a compound transgene as described below. While the choice of
the insert designation is up to the investigator, the following guidelines
should be used:</P>
<P>a. The insert designation should identify the inserted sequence and
indicate important features. Where the insertion utilizes sequences from a
named gene, it should contain the standard symbol for that gene. If the
insertion is a compound construct consisting of the promoter of one gene
linked to the coding region of another, the insertion may be designated
using the symbol of the first, separated by a hyphen from the symbol of the
second. One or both symbols should be truncated if the total number of
letters exceeds six or the insert designation and the laboratory assigned
number (C. a. below) together are 11 characters or less. Different
promoter/gene constructs can be distinguished by the different serial
numbers and lab codes added as in C below. If the gene symbol exceeds the
spaces available, use the beginning letters of the symbol. For example,
Ins1 should be used within the symbols of transgenes containing either
coding or regulatory sequences from the mouse insulin gene (<I>Ins-1</I>)
as an important part of the insert designation. </P>
<P>b. Avoid using symbols that are identical to other named genes in the
same species. For example, the use of "Ins" to designate "insertion" would
be incorrect. </P>
<P>c. Ideally two different gene constructs should not be identified by
identical insert designations. </P>
<P>d. To aid communication, standard abbreviations can be used as part of
the insert designation. </P>
<P>These presently include: </P>
<P>An anonymous sequence </P>
<P>Gen genomic </P>
<P>Im insertional mutation </P>
<P>Nc noncoding sequence </P>
<P>Rp reporter sequence </P>
<P>Sn synthetic sequence </P>
<P>Et enhancer trap construct </P>
<P>Pt promoter trap construct </P>
<P>This list will be expanded as needed and maintained by the International
Nomenclature Committee. </P>
<P>e. The insert designation should identify the inserted sequence, not its
location or phenotype. </P>
<P>C. Laboratory Assigned Number and Laboratory Registration Code is a
number and letter combination that must uniquely identify each
independently inserted sequence. It is formed of two parts: </P>
<P>a. The Laboratory Assigned Number is a number from 1 to 99,999 that is
uniquely assigned by the laboratory to each stably transmitted insertion.
This assignment should be done at the time germline transmission is
confirmed. The number can have some intra-laboratory meaning or simply be a
number in a series of transgenes produced by the laboratory. The same
number cannot be used more than once by each laboratory. </P>
<P>b. The Laboratory Registration Code is uniquely assigned to all
laboratories originating transgenic animals, DNA loci or inbred strains.
Laboratories that have already been assigned such a code for other
genetically defined mice and rats should use the same code.The registry of
these codes is maintained by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources
(ILAR), 2101 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20418.</P>
<P>2. The complete designation identifies the inserted site, and provides a
symbol for unique identification. When a mutation that produces an
observable phenotype is caused by the insertion, the locus so identified
must be named according to standard procedures for the species involved.
The allele of the locus identified by the insertion can then be identified
by the abbreviated transgene symbol according to the conventions adopted
for communication, and supplies a unique identifier to distinguish it from
all other insertions. Each insertion retains the same symbol even if it is
placed on a different genetic background. Specific lines of animals
carrying the insertion should be additionally distinguished by a stock
designator preceding the transgene symbol. In general, this designator will
follow the established conventions for the naming of strains or stocks of
the particular animal used. In cases in which the background is a mixture
of several strains, stocks, or both, the transgene symbol should be used
without a strain or stock name.</P>
