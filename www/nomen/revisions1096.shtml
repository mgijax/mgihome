<H2 align=CENTER>Nomenclature Rules Revisions - October 1996</H2>

<P>
The International Committee approved the rules changes shown below
at its meeting in Paris 7 October 1996:<BR>

<P>
<B>Revised rules - Gene Nomenclature<BR>
</B>
<P>
1.1.1. <B>Add: </B>Hyphens shall be deleted from gene names as
well as symbols.<BR>

<P>
1.1.2.9. Expressed sequence tagged (EST) loci, <B>when mapped
to chromosomes,</B> <B>may be given either D symbols with a final
<I>e</I> for <U>e</U>xpressed or</B> the symbol <I>ESTM###</I>,
where M identifies mouse as opposed to human EST loci.and ###
= a serial number assigned from the Mouse Genome Database (MGD).
<BR>

<P>
<B>New rule - Gene Nomenclature::<BR>
</B>
<P>
1.1.7.7a. When an existing gene is replaced with a different,
functional gene, called a &quot;knock-in,&quot; the symbol shall
be written as an allele of the original gene. For example, if
<I>Myf5</I> is deleted and replaced with <I>Myod</I>, <I>Myf5<SUP>Myod-labcode#</SUP></I>
when there is a more-or-less complete knock-in, or by <I>Myf5<SUP>m-labcode#</SUP></I>
when it is a domain swap of some kind. The domain(s) swapped should
be indicated by letters such as P=promotor, E=enhancing element,
E#, = exon #; e.g. <I>Myf5<SUP>mP-labcode#</SUP></I>. The labcode
is an investigator or institution's Laboratory Registration Code
(used also for strain holders, DNA symbols, and targeted mutations)
and the # is a serial number for that laboratory.<BR>

<P>
<B>New rule - Strain nomenclature<BR>
</B>
<P>
3.6. Advanced Intercross Lines (AIL) are made by producing an
F2 generation between two inbred strains and then, in each subsequent
generation, intercrossing mice but avoiding sibling matings. The
purpose is to increase the possibility of tightly linked genes
recombining. Symbols shall combine outbred stock and mixed inbred
strain nomenclature with the generation number included in the
symbol to distinguish these stocks from mixed inbred strains.
Generations shall be designated G3, G4, etc. beginning with the
first non-sib cross after the F2 generation. E.g. The stock Pri:B6,D2-G#
is an AIL created at <U>Pri</U>nceton from the inbred strains
C57BL/6 x DBA/2. The G number will increase with each generation.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Reminder:</B> There are two ways in which mode of inheritance
of mutant genes is conveyed in the gene symbol:
<P>
Inheritance of spontaneous mutations is indicated by the first
letter of the gene symbol; inheritance of all other genes (cloned
genes, targeted mutations, etc.) is indicated in the allele symbol.
The rule is #1.1.7.2 in the Rules and Guidelines (available at
the URL address http://www.informatics.jax.org/support/submissions/nomen/).
