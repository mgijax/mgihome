<h2>Basic Nomenclature Rules and Guidelines</h2>

<p>When symbolizing and naming novel genes and genomic features, it is important that these symbols and names be unique identifiers. The MGD Nomenclature Committee (nomen@informatics.jax.org) provides advice and assistance in assigning new symbols and names. Below are some basic rules and guidelines to assist in the symbol and naming process. 
<h3>Mouse symbols:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Should be 3-5 characters; should not exceed 10 characters.
<li>Should begin with an upper case letter, followed by all lower case letters, except for recessive mutations which should begin with a lower case letter.
<li>Should not include tissue specificity and molecular weight designations.
<li>Should be italicized in published articles.
<li>Should be punctuated only to separate two adjacent numbers (e.g., Lamb1-2) or for related (e.g., Es10-rs1) sequences and pseudogenes 
(e.g., Adh-ps1).
<li>For family members: &nbsp;Use common stem symbol (e.g., <a href="genefamilies/claudin.shtml">Cldn#</a>)
<li>For orthologous genes in other vertebrate species: &nbsp; Use the same symbol whenever possible in human, rat, and mouse.
<li>For homologous genes in invertebrate or prokaryote species:
  <ol type=a>
  <li>If it is a true homolog, use the approved symbol for that species, but include the word "homolog" at the end of the name followed by the name of the species in parentheses; for example, Cdc20 for cell division cycle 20 homolog (S. cerevisiae).
  <li>If there is more than one mouse homolog, assign the serial number after the word "homolog;" for example, Atoh1 and Atoh2 for atonal homolog 1 (Drosophila) and atonal homolog 2 (Drosophila), respectively.
  <li>If the gene in question is not a true homolog, use the letter "l" to denote  "-like" designations; for example, Ash2l for ash2 (absent, small, or homeotic)-like (Drosophila).
  </ol>
<li>ESTs and BAC/YAC ends:  &nbsp;Use the assigned sequence accession identification numbers.
<li>STSs: 
  <ol type=a>
  <li>Use the convention D#Xxx%e, where: 
<TABLE bgcolor="white" border=0 width=40% cellpadding=8> 

     <tr><td width="6%">#</td> <td width="2%">=</td> <td width="92%">chromosome location</td></tr>
     <tr><td>Xxx</td> <td>= </td><td>approved lab code</td></tr>
     <tr><td>%</td>a <TD>=</TD> <TD>serial number in series</TD></TR>
</table>
  <LI>Obtain approved lab codes from ILAR (Institute for Laboratory Animal Research:
 <a href="http://www4.nas.edu/cls/ilarhome.nsf">http://www4.nas.edu/cls/ilarhome.nsf</a>
   <li>Add the trailing "e" only when the DNA segment is expressed.
  </ol>
</ol>
<h3>Mouse names:</h3>
<ol>
 <li>Should be brief and specific.
 <li>Should convey the character or function of the gene.
</ol>

<h3>Other information when publishing:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chromosome designations:
  <ol>
  <li>Use upper case C when referring to a specific mouse chromosome (e.g., Chromosome 15).
  <li>Do not use a period (.) after the abbreviation of a chromosome (e.g., do not write Chr 15 as Chr.15).
  </ol>
<li>Protein designations:
  <ol>
  <li>Use all upper case letters.
  <li>Do not italicize.
  </ol>
</ul>
