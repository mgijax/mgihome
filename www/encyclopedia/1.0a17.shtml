<h2><em>Encyclopedia</em> 1.0a17 for Macintosh</h2>

Version 1.0a17 of the Encyclopedia of the Mouse Genome incorporates a number
of enhancements. If you have any questions or problems
regarding this Macintosh version of the <em>Encyclopedia</em>, please contact
Mouse Genome Informatics <A HREF="../support/support.shtml"> User Support</a><p> 

<h3>New Options for Interaction with WWW Browsers</h3>

From the <strong>Preferences</strong> dialog box in the <em>Encyclopedia</em>,
you can select either <strong>NCSA Mosaic</strong> or <strong>Netscape</strong> for interaction with <em>Encyclopedia</em>.
<p>
You can also choose a web site other than www.informatics.jax.org. This is
intended for those users who wish to specify an MGD mirror site for MGD/<em>Encyclopedia</em> interaction. Currently, there are <A HREF="../mirrors/mirrors.shtml">mirror sites</a> in Australia, 
France, Japan and the United Kingdom.  
<br>
<em><A HREF="procs.shtml#sws">Here's how...</a></em>
<p>
Interaction with Netscape is fully supported.  When you activate the option
to have the <em>Encyclopedia</em> interact with MGD, then when you click on
a marker displayed on a map, MGD will automatically retrieve detailed 
information on the selected marker. 
<br>
<em><A HREF="procs.shtml#linkup">Here's how...</a></em>
<p>
To enable full interaction of Mosaic or Netscape, you must configure each 
browser so that the <em>Encyclopedia</em> is recognized as a helper application.

<h3>Problems fixed in 1.0a17</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li><em>The option to save a copy of a map fails</em><br>
You can save a copy of a map as an <em>Encyclopedia</em> file.
The option to save a map as a PICT file is not available.
<p>
<li><em>Page breaks do not display properly</em><br>
Page breaks now display properly. The option to show page breaks
is available from the <strong>Map</strong> menu.<p>


<li><em>Cannot see homologies displayed on a chromosome map</em><br>
When you first open a map, the map window is horizontally scrollable and 
homologies are visible.

<p>
<li><em>The chromosome line does not appear in a print-out of a map</em><br>
When you print an <em>Encyclopedia</em> map, the chromosome line appears in the printout. You do not need to alter print options from default values.

<p>
<li><em>Gray patches appear on the map pane</em><br>
The map window refreshes properly as you scroll through a map so that
the background does not break-up into patches.
