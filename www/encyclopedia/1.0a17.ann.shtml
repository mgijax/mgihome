<p>

<strong>New Features</strong><br>
<ul>
<li><em>Integration with MGD via Netscape is supported</em><br>

Now you can configure Netscape to recognize the <em>Encyclopedia</em> so that you can
retrieve marker details from MGD by selecting a symbol displayed on an <em>Encyclopedia</em> map. <p>

<li><em>Encyclopedia Prefenences box has been modified</em><br>

You can change the host name in the Preferences to specify an MGD mirror site for
MGD/<em>Encyclopedia</em> interaction. Currently, there are <a href="../other/mirrors.shtml"> mirror sites</a> in Australia, France, Israel, Japan and the United Kingdom.
<p>
You can select either Netscape or Mosaic for MGD/<em>Encyclopedia</em> interaction.  You can also disable this interaction. <p>

<li><em>Option to create text and picture clippings</em><br>

You can point and drag the cursor to define an area of an <em>Encyclopedia</em> map or text pane, then drag it to the desktop as a "clipping."<p>
</ul><p>
