<HR>
<A NAME="S1"><H3>About This User Guide</H3>
</A>
<H4>Purpose</H4>
This user guide provides information on the features and operations
of the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> mouse genetic map viewing application, 
version 1.0a17 for the Macintosh.
<p>
<H4>Scope</H4>
This guide provides information only on version 1.0a17 of 
the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> for the Macintosh.
<p>
<H4>Audience</H4>
The intended audience is anyone interested in using the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> to
graphically display mouse genetic marker information retrieved from 
the Mouse Genome Database (MGI).

<A NAME="S2"><H3><EM>Encyclopedia</EM>
 1.0a17 for the Macintosh: Overview</H3>
 </A>

The <B>Encyclopedia of the Mouse Genome</B> ( <EM>Encyclopedia</EM>) 
was first released in 1990 for the UNIX operating system 
only. This original version provided options to access mouse 
genetic linkage maps, &quot;comparative&quot; maps of mouse 
and human (or other mammalian species) homologies, cytogenetic maps, 
phenotype records stored in the Mouse Locus Catalog (MLC), and marker 
records stored in "LocusBase." Thus, 
the early application was, indeed, &quot;encyclopedic&quot; in scope, 
providing unified access to several separate data stores.
<p>
In 1994, the Mouse Genome Database (MGI) integrated all these data sources into 
one comprehensive information resource available on the WWW, thus taking 
over the broad functionality of the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> so that, now, the 
primary function of the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> is to provide a graphic 
display of genetic linkage information for the mouse with the option to
include homologous markers from one of over 60 mammalian species. 
<P>
The first Macintosh version of the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> 
also became available in 1994. Several updated versions followed and the 
current release, version 1.0a17, became available in April 1996.

Configuring Netscape for MGI/ <EM>Encyclopedia</EM>
 Interaction</A>

<P CLASS="Body">

There are several ways in which MGI and the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> can interact:
</P>
<UL>
<LI CLASS="Bulleted">

Using the Linkage Maps query form in MGI, you can search 
for markers on a chromosome and retrieve the information in 
<EM>Encyclopedia</EM> format for display as a linkage map.<BR>

<LI CLASS="Bulleted">

MGI can automatically start the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM>

The <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> application can activate a search for a marker record in MGI when you click on a marker symbol displayed on an <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> map.
</LI>
</UL>
<P CLASS="Body">

Currently, you can take advantage of all these features only with the Netscape browser (version 2.0 or above).
Netscape must be configured to see the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> as a helper application if you want to execute a linkage map query in MGI and have the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> application automatically start-up. The procedure, given below, is also available from the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> Web page.
<p>
It is possible to configure NCSA Mosaic for this interaction but since this
browser application has ceased development, instructions for configuring
Mosaic are not given here.

<A NAME="S10"><H4>Features of the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> Map Display Window
</H4></A>
<P CLASS="Body">

The <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> map display window has four panes. In the example shown in Figure 1, the chromosome map is displayed on the left side of the display. The pane on the lower right side of the window shows the alphabetical list of markers included in this map display. (The other panes on the right side of the display are not used, currently.) If you click on a marker in this list, the map display will be adjusted so that the region of the chromosome where this marker is located will be displayed.

</P>
<P CLASS="Body">

Figure 1 shows a region of Chromosome 1 with human homologies. Note that the mouse markers are to the right of the chromosome line; homologies appear on the left. For each human homolog, the Chromosome and cytogenetic location are given.

When an <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> map display opens, you see a small

inside the box, press the mouse button and &quot;drag&quot; the 
bar from &quot;0&quot; to a higher number, you see the chromosome elongate 
so that markers are not so densely packed together. When you use the 
zoom box, you need to use the scroll bars to center the image within 
the window. You can drag the bar down to &quot;zoom out&quot; and bring 
the map display back to normal resolution. You can also use the 
<STRONG> Zoom In</STRONG> and <STRONG> Zoom Out</STRONG> options under the 
<STRONG> Map</STRONG> menu to accomplish the same thing.

Saving a Map File</STRONG>

<P CLASS="Body">
Under the File menu on the menu bar, you see an option to Save as.... This

</H3></A>
<P CLASS="Body">

At the present time, the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> provides options for MGI/<EM>
Encyclopedia</EM> interaction via Netscape 2.0 or above and NCSA Mosaic. 
Since Mosaic has fallen into disuse, the discussion that follows applies 
primarily the use of Netscape options. At present, the features described 
below are not available for use with Internet Explorer or other browsers.
</P>
<H4>
Using the Preferences Dialog Box
</H4>
<P CLASS="Body">

Under the <STRONG> File</STRONG> menu, the last option is <STRONG>
Preferences...</STRONG>. When you select this option, the Preferences dialog 
box is displayed as shown in Figure 3. At the top of this screen is shown a 
text field with a host name. By default, the field contains the address for the 
MGI Home Site in the US. This address determines which MGI site will be 
accessed for marker detail queries initiated by clicking a marker symbol 
displayed on an <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> map. So, for example, if you are a 
MGI user in Japan, and want to run marker queries from an <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> 
map, you would want to change the host name in this box to the Japan 
mirror site, namely, 
<STRONG"> www.niai.affrc.go.jp</STRONG>.

The Preferences dialog box also provides the option to select either Netscape or NCSA Mosaic as the browser for the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> to access for MGI/<EM>Encyclopedia</EM> interaction. If you choose 
<STRONG> None</STRONG>, then the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> will not work with any browser until you specify, during an <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> session, that you want to &quot;link to browser,&quot; at which point the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> will link to Netscape, by default.

</P>
<P CLASS="Body">

If you select one of the browsers, then, when you click on a marker displayed on an <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> map, the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> will run a query for the marker in MGI using the browser specified in the Preferences dialog and will start up the browser application, if it is not already running. The Host Name
 and browser selection buttons are the only accessible options in the Preferences dialog box.
</P>
<H4>Using the Map Menu &quot;Link to Browser&quot; Option</EM>
</H4>
<P CLASS="Body">

Under the <STRONG> Map</STRONG> menu on the menu bar, the last option is 
<STRONG> Link to Browser</STRONG>. This is an on/off switch that you can use 
anytime during an <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> session to activate or de-activate MGI/<EM>
Encyclopedia</EM> interaction. If you choose to link to a browser and no 
browser is currently running, then, the next time you select a marker symbol 
on an <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> map display, the browser specified in 
your <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> Preferences will start-up and MGI will display the 
detailed marker record. If no browser is specified in the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> 
preferences, the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> will search for and start-up Netscape. 
Once you have linked to a browser and the browser is running, then whenever you 
click on a marker on an <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> map, MGI will display the detail 
record until you de-select the option to Link to Browser, or, you end 
the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> session.
