<h2> Mouse Genome Sequencing Initiative Progress </h2>

<P> The working draft of the mouse genome is scheduled for completion in
the spring of 2003. This working draft will cover 90% of the genome at 4-5X
coverage. The draft sequence will have many gaps, but will be useful for
identifying most of the genes encoded in the mouse genome. </p>

<p> The complete, finished mouse genome should be available no later than
the spring of 2005.
