         <H3>About MGS</H3>
The overall goal of the Mouse Genome Sequence (MGS) project
is to integrate emerging mouse genomic sequence data with
the genetic and biological data available in MGD and GXD.
MGS is part of the informatics infrastructure needed to support
mouse-human comparative genomics.  The specific aims of the
project include:
<UL>
<LI> Working cooperatively with sequencing centers and genome 
annotation groups to apply baseline sequence annotation to 
mouse genomic sequence.
<P>
<LI> Implementing a data integration process for connecting 
mouse genome sequence with existing biological knowledge.
<P>
<LI> Developing a web-based interface for querying and 
visualizing the results of the mouse genome sequence 
annotation-integration process, including sequence alignments 
of mouse-human orthologs.
