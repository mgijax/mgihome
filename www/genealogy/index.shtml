<H2>The Genealogy Chart of Inbred Strains</H2>

The laboratory mouse is the primary model organism for the study of human
biology and disease.  Inbred strains of mice represent unique fixed genotypes
that can be repeatedly accessed as homogeneous experimental individuals, with
predictable phenotypes and defined allelic composition.  Hundreds of inbred
strains of mice have been described and new strains continue to be developed,
taking advantage of the rich genetic diversity among the strains and the ease
with which the mouse genome can be manipulated.<P>

The Genealogy Chart of Inbred Strains graphically depicts the origins and
relationships of inbred mouse strains.  This Chart was originally published
in<P>

The Genealogy Chart is available
as a <a href="<!--#include file='include/ftp_url.html'-->pub/informatics/datasets/misc/genealogy/genealogy.pdf">
downloadable PDF file.</A> (file size: 4398 Kbytes) <P>

Accompanying the Chart is a 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/ftp_url.html'-->pub/informatics/datasets/misc/genealogy/genealogy_key.html"> "Key to the Chart of Strain Genealogy"</A> providing for each strain on the Chart, its location coordinates on the Chart, a reference to its genealogy, and an indication whether it is extant. 
<P>

These files are made available through the courtesy of Nature Genetics.  At a later time,
the Chart and data in it will be incorporated into the Mouse Genome Database
(MGD), where fuller historical tracking will be documented and the Chart
will be continuously updated and expanded.<P>
