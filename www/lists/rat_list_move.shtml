<br>
<br>
<P>Rat-list has joined the <a href="http://rgd.mcw.edu/dcforum/dcboard.cgi">Rat Community Forum</a> (RCF) at the Rat Genome Database. </p>


<p>The two rat forums (rat-list and RCF) have been merged into one.<br>
The rat-list server at this site is being discontinued and all its subscribers have been pre-subscribed to RCF. <br>
You can subscribe/unsubscribe, read messages, and search the RCF archives from the 
<a href="http://rgd.mcw.edu/rcf/config.pl">RCF configuration page</a> .<br>

<p>For those interested in mouse, rodent, and mammalian genetics, we continue to support 
<a href="lists.shtml">mgi-list</a> and encourage you to participate in this forum.</P>
