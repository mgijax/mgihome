<p>The following groups provide GO annotations for mouse genes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/">MGI</a>  -  experimental-literature-based annotation to mouse gene products, as well as electronic-based annotation by translation of UniProt keywords, Interpro Domains, and EC numbers.</li> <br>

<li><a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/">UniProt (Universal Protein Resource)</a> -  protein annotation from many organisms in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Protein Knowledgebase (a protein sequence database).</li> <br>

<li><a href="http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/">HGNC (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee)</a> - approved nomenclature for human genes and close collaboration with MGI in establishing nomenclature for mouse genes.  Through HUGOA (Human Gene Ontology Annotation},  the knowledge base used to assign nomenclature is applied to GO annotaton.  </li><br>

<li><a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/site/">IntAct (Protein Interaction Group at EBI)</a> - literature-curated protein interaction data.  </li> <br>

<li>PINC (Proteome Incorporated) -  annotations created in 2001 for NCBI and extracted from EntrezGene.</li> <br>

<li><a href="http://www.roslin.ac.uk/">RI (Roslin Institute)</a> -  annotation through several database systems, including ArkDB, maintained at their site. </li> 
</ul>
