<P>
Genes in MGI are annotated using GO terms.  Several query forms, "Genes,
Markers and Phenotypes," "Linkage Map," "Gene Expression Data," and "cDNA
Clone" provide a "Gene Classifications" search field that enables you to enter
a GO term or phrase for searching.  A term is entered in the search box and
the ontologies to be examined are checked.  To improve and refine their
searches, users should become familiar with the available terms in the
ontologies (see Molecular Function, Cellular Component, and Biological Process
links in the left frame). 

Please note that the GO vocabularies are hierarchical. Consequently, a search term returns gene
records annotated not only to terms matching your query but also gene records annotated to more 
detailed terms related to your query term (but not necessarily containing the text you entered). For
example, if you enter: <b>carbohydrate metabolism</b>, you will also identify genes with the annotation: 
<b>glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis</b>.
<!--Please note that the current implementation is a
text search only, and does not identify genes at lower levels of the
hierarchical vocabulary if the lower level terms do not contain the text you
entered. For example, if you entered: <B>carbohydrate metabolism</B> you would
not identify genes that had the annotation <B>fructose catabolism</B>.-->
<P>
Each gene returned by the query is linked to a marker detail page with the
associated ontology, GO term, evidence statement, and publication from which
the annotation was discerned.
<P>
MGI queries return information about mouse genes.  To query the GO
simultaneously across multiple species, a prototype query interface is
available (see
<A HREF = "http://www.fruitfly.org/annot/go" target="_top">Gene Ontology Applet</A>).
