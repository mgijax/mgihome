GO terms are grouped into three broad categories:
<DL>
<H4>Molecular Function</H4>
   <DD>
   "Molecular function" describes the tasks performed by individual gene products; examples are <B>transcription factor</B> and <B>DNA helicase</B>.
</DD></DL>
<DL>
<H4>Biological Process</H4>
   <DD>
   "Biological process" describes broad biological goals, such as <B>mitosis</B> or <B>purine metabolism</B>, that are accomplished by ordered assemblies of molecular functions.
</DD></DL>
<DL>
<H4>Cellular Component</H4>
   <DD>
   "Cellular component" encompasses subcellular structures, locations, and macromolecular complexes; examples include <B>nucleus, telomere</B>, and <B>origin recognition complex</B>.
</DD></DL>
