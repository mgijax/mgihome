<P><A NAME="Annotating"></A>
MGI assigns GO annotation by either manual curation of published experimental literature or automated electronic-based methods. The annotated records include the supporting references. 
MGI collaborates with several groups outside of MGI in collecting GO annotation for mouse genes. See <a href="go_curators.shtml">GO Curators</a> for the list of groups that provide  annotations for mouse genes.</p>
<p>Electronic-based annotation strategies include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>mapping the Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers associated with a gene to the EC number attached to GO terms (referenced with J:72245)</LI>
<LI>translating SWISS-PROT "keywords" associated with a gene to appropriate GO terms (referenced with J:60000)</LI>
<li>mapping InterPro domains associated with a gene to GO terms (referenced with J:72247)</li>
<LI>associating GO terms to a gene, based upon proper gene nomenclature (referenced with J:56000).
 <ul>
   <li>For example, G-protein linked receptor activity genes can be annotated as:
    <UL>
    <LI>Molecular Function: G protein linked receptor</LI>    
    <LI>Cellular Component: integral to plasma membrane</LI>    
    <LI>Biological Process: G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway</LI>
    </UL>
    </li>

</UL> 
<li>reviewed computational alanysis (RCA) performed by the Riken consortium (attributed to MGI reference J:80000)</li>
 
</UL> 


<p>If you have questions, need assistance, or wish to report a problem with specific annotations, please contact MGI at mgi-help@informatics.jax.org.</p>
