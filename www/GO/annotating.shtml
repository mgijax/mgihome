MGI uses database-mining and other strategies to automate gene annotation.  The electronic annotations are attributed to MGI references J:56000 and J:60000. In addition, scientific curators review the published literature and extract information to manually annotate gene records.  The annotated records include the supporting references.</P>
<p>Automated annotation strategies include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>mapping the Enzyme Commission (EC) number associated with a gene to the EC number attached to GO terms</LI>
<LI>translating SWISS-PROT "Keywords" associated with a gene to appropriate GO terms</LI>
<LI>associating GO terms to a gene based upon proper gene nomenclature; for example, G-protein coupled receptor genes can be annotated as:
    <UL>
    <LI>Molecular Function: G protein linked receptor</LI>    
    <LI>Cellular Component: integral plasma membrane protein</LI>    
    <LI>Biological Process: G protein linked receptor signalling pathway</LI>
    </UL></li>
</UL>    
<p>If you have questions, need assistance, or wish to report a problem with specific annotations, please contact MGI at mgi-help@informatics.jax.org.</p>
