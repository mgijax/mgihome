<hr>
<P>
MGI uses database-mining and other strategies to automate gene annotation.  The electronic annotations are attributed to MGI references J:56000, J:60000.
</P>
<P>
In addition, scientific curators review the published literature and extract information to manually annotate gene records.  The annotated records include the supporting references.
</P>
Automated annotation strategies include:
<UL>
<LI>
mapping the Enzyme Commission (EC) number associated with a gene to the EC number attached to GO terms
</LI>
<LI>
translating SWISS-PROT "Keywords" associated with a gene to appropriate GO terms
</LI>
<LI>
associating GO terms to a gene based upon proper gene nomenclature; for example, G-protein coupled receptor genes can be annotated as:
</LI>
<UL>
<LI>
Molecular Function:</TD><TD> G protein linked receptor</TD>             
</LI>    
<LI>
Cellular Component: integral plasma membrane protein            
</LI>    
<LI>
Biological Process: G protein linked receptor signalling pathway        
</LI>
</UL>
</UL>    
If you have questions, need assistance, or wish to report a problem with specific annotations, please contact MGI at mgi-help@informatics.jax.org.
