<H2>Mouse Genome Informatics Overview</H2> <p>This overview presents a brief description of the features and data content of the
Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) resource available on the World Wide Web.

<P>The MGI web site provides integrated access to various sources for information on the genetics and biology of the laboratory
mouse. MGI projects comprise the Mouse Genome Database (<a href="<!--#include file='include/glossary_url.html'-->#MGD">MGD</A>), the Gene Expression Database (<a href="<!--#include file='include/glossary_url.html'-->#GXD">GXD</A>), Mouse Genome Sequence 
(<a href="<!--#include file='include/glossary_url.html'-->#MGS">MGS</A>) project, and related resources including the Mouse Tumor 
Biology database, the Rat Data resource, Michael Festing's Listing of Inbred Strains of Mice and  Rats,  and  MouseBLAST.

<P>The goals of the MGI projects are to capture, store and manage high quality data suitable for analysis and integration with other
biological data; provide efficient access to these data through an easy-to-use, flexible user interface; develop software tools that facilitate
analysis of data and enable researchers to display data in a variety of graphical and  textual formats;  promote  integration  of
MGI information with  other scientific information resources by creating links between MGI and other scientific web sites. We aim to
continually modify and develop our information resources in response to the changing  information  needs of the scientific community.
(See the <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgihome_url.html'-->/other/mgicron.shtml">MGI  Chronology</A> for highlights of MGI
project history.) <H3><A  NAME="mgd">MGD Project</A></H3> <p>MGD includes information on mouse genetic
<a href="<!--#include file='include/glossary_url.html'-->#marker">markers</A>, molecular segments
(<a href="<!--#include file='include/glossary_url.html'-->#probe">probes</A>,
<a href="<!--#include file='include/glossary_url.html'-->#primer">primers</A> and
<a href="<!--#include file='include/glossary_url.html'-->#YAC">YACs</A>),
<a href="<!--#include file='include/glossary_url.html'-->#phenotype">phenotypes</A>, comparative mapping data, graphical displays of
<a href="<!--#include file='include/glossary_url.html'-->#linkage_map">linkage</A>,

 strain distribution patterns for <a href="<!--#include file='include/glossary_url.html'-->#recombinant_inbred">recombinant inbred
strains(RIs)</A> and cross <a href="<!--#include file='include/glossary_url.html'-->#haplotype">haplotypes</A>. Sources for
information in the database include  the scientific  literature,  DNA  mapping  panel  data produced by various researchers, the MIT
Whitehead Institute (MIT genetic  and physical mapping data), WashU and the  I.M.A.G.E.  consortium.  MGD  is  updated daily. Since
it first became available on the WWW, MGD has continued to  evolve, expanding its data coverage, improving data handling, and
providing several  new data manipulation and display tools.

<P>MGD is integrated with the  Encyclopedia of the Mouse  Genome, a  
<A  HREF="<!--#include file='include/glossary_url.html'-->#genetic_map">genetic map</a> viewing
application for the Macintosh platform. You can configure Netscape to recognize the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> as a "helper" application.
You can then  use the Linkage Maps query form to generate a linkage map in "<EM>Encyclopedia</EM>" format. The <EM>Encyclopedia</EM>
will automatically start up when  you  execute the search. The  resulting  map  displays  marker  symbols  arranged  along  the
chromosome. You can click on a marker and Netscape will search MGD and  retrieve the detail record for the selected marker for
display in a browser  window.  You can build an <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> linkage map using information from MGD marker records,
Chromosome Committee Reports,  MIT mouse  DNA  marker  maps,  and  DNA mapping panels.

<P>Another format for map display is the "Web Map,"  a  type  of HTML file that provides a graphical display of cytogenetic and
linkage maps on a WWW browser page. The appearance is similar to that of a "PostScript"  map.  The marker symbols on the map are
linked to detail  marker  records  in  MGD.

<P><A NAME="mlc">Phenotype</A> records in  MGDhave their origin in the
<a href="<!--#include file='include/glossary_url.html'-->#MLC">Mouse Locus Catalog (MLC)</A>, formerly an independent database. You
can search for phenotype records using  the  Genes,  Alleles,  and Phenotypes query form. MLC full-text searching capability relies
on the  Glimpse search engine. Glimpse is easy-to-use and provides very reliable query  results. In addition, an integrated OMIM/MLC query form is
available which lets you enter one search string  to  execute  a  query  in  both  MLC  and  On-line  Mendelian Inheritance in Man
(OMIM), a database maintained  by  the  National  Center  for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). <P>MGD is closely linked with the
Gene Expression Literature Index. The Gene Expression Literature Index is a collection  of  references  to  the  scientific
literature reporting data on endogenous gene expression during mouse embryonic development. MGD provides links to Gene Expression
Literature Index records through genetic marker  detail records. The Gene Expression Literature Index provides links to  MGD
references  and  genetic  marker  records. 

<H4>MGD Data</H4>
<p>MGD is updated on  a  daily  basis  by  biologists  on  the editorial
staff who scan the current scientific  literature,  extract  relevant data and enter it in MGD. Increasingly, MGD acquires data
through  large scale electronic transfer. Such data include mouse physical  mapping  data  downloaded from MIT, data generated by the collaborative efforts of WashU,  the  I.M.A.G.E. consortium, ATCC, and Mouse Genome Informatics. The data interface  is intended to be flexible and comprehensive so that each view of particular records in  MGD provides links to any related data throughout MGD and, where possible, to  other databases on the Internet.

<P>MGD contains the following kinds  of information:

<P>In addition, information on <A NAME="rflp">genetic polymorphisms</A> is extracted from probe/segment records records in MGD. The
Polymorphisms query form enables you to search directly  for such information and display it. (See 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/polymorphism_help.shtml#res">details</a> on the content of the display in polymorphism query results.)

<P><EM><A NAME="hom"><B>Mammalian Homology</B></A></EM><BR> MGD contains
<a href="<!--#include file='include/glossary_url.html'-->#homology">homology</A> information for mouse, human and 15 other mammalian species. Most of the information  for  homologies  is
extracted from the published scientific literature. In general,  these  papers  explicitly report homology relationships  and  MGD
reflects  that  published information. (<EM>See</EM> information on 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/homology_criteria.shtml">criteria</A> used for
establishing homology.)

<P>An homology record shows the <a href="<!--#include file='include/glossary_url.html'-->#gene_symbol">symbol</A>, species, <a

other mammalian databases are provided where possible. MGD homology records may link to GDB, BovMap, PiGBASE, RATMAP, SheepBase, or
ArkDB. 

<P> Every homology assertion is supported by one or more references.  The display of an homology reference includes the J number of
the reference, a short format citation, gene symbol and species. (<EM>See</EM> 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/homology_help.shtml#detail">details</A> on
the content of a homology record as it appears in the query results.)

<P>  Homology information is presented in three other formats: Oxford  Grid, comparative map and Homology Map View. An Oxford Grid
display presents an overview  of  homology between two species. Currently, this kind of comparison  is supported  for  the following
species:  Mouse,  Human,  Cat,  Cattle,  Rat,  Pig,  Sheep. <P>  The comparative map display relies on the Linkage Map application to
build a graphic display of a map of a mouse chromosome (or chromosomal region)  which  includes homologies from the comparison
species. See, for example, the comparative map for a 2 cM region around the mouse gene 

<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/linkmap.cgi?midpoint=52.3&cmrange=2&format=Web+Map&source=MGD&dsegments=0&syntenics=0&chromosome=1&species=2">Acrg</A> 
showing human homology.

<P> The Homology Map View displays the mouse genome as  the  consensus genetic map, with either human or rat orthologs labeled by
chromosome of origin and displayed next to  the  corresponding  segment  of  the  mouse  genome.  The Homology Map View is accessible
from the <A HREF="http://www.informatics.jax.org/menus/homology_menu.shtml">Homology Menu</A> page.

<p><EM><A NAME="map"><B>Mapping Data</B></A></EM> <BR> MGD contains genetic mapping and linkage data, including haplotype data for
linkage crosses, recombinant inbred (RI) strain distribution patterns,
<a href="<!--#include file='include/glossary_url.html'-->#in_situ">in-situ hybridization</A>data,

information, and physical mapping information.

<H5><A NAME="RIdata">Recombinant Inbred Strain Distribution Patterns Composite Data Set</A></H5> 
The RI Data portion of  MGD  mapping data records has been collected and organized into composite reports accessible using the 
Composite Recombinant Inbred Data Sets from MGD query form. The  information is displayed in tabular format with each COLUMN 
representing a strain  and  each ROW representing the distribution of alleles of a locus  across  these strains.

<H5><A NAME="RCdata">Recombinant Congenic Strain Distribution Patterns Composite Data Set</A></H5> Composite Recombinant Congenic
Strain Distribution Patterns data can be retrieved using a new query form accessed in the "Maps and  Mapping Data" section of MGD.
Information on four recombinant congenic  strain  sets  is currently available. Data include the progenitor strains for each  RCS
set  and tables showing the allelic distribution for each genetic marker that has been typed in each of the recombinant  congenic
strains.  Each  row  represents  the typing for a genetic marker and each column  represents  alleles  carried  by  a specific
recombinant congenic strain of the RCS set. Format of the report is very similar to that of the Composite Recombinant  Inbred
Strains  distribution patterns. <p> <p>For more information regarding the use of congenic  strains  to  analyze  traits controlled by
multiple genes, see Peter Demant's paper, <BLOCKQUOTE>"Recombinant Congenic Strains - A New Tool for Analyzing Genetic Traits
Determined  by More Than One Gene, " Immunogenetics 24: 416-422, 1986.</BLOCKQUOTE> 
<p> 
<p> <H5><A NAME="DNAdata">DNA Mapping Panel Data Sets </A> </H5> 
<p> Data  from the  major DNA mapping panels have been downloaded into MGD and are accessible through the DNA
Mapping Panel Data Sets from MGD query form and from the Linkage Maps  form. The data sets include: <p> <ul> <LI>Copeland-Jenkins:

</ul>

<p> DNA Mapping Panel data may be displayed in tabular format, where each column represents a single offspring of the cross, and each row indicates for each locus  which  allele  is present in each of the offspring. The order of rows is determined by linkage  on the chromosome and the locus nearest the centromer is at the top of the display. Centimorgan locations for loci in the cross are determined by the provider of the cross. <P>

<H5>Mapping Experiment Records</H5> (<EM>See</EM> 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/mapping_data.shtml">details</A> on the content of various mapping
experiment records as displayed in query results.)

<P><EM><B>Graphical Map Displays</B></EM><BR> <H5>Linkage  Maps</H5> Marker records in MGD include available information on genetic mapping locations from several sources: MGD, Chromosome Committees (up to the year 2000), MIT. MGD provides  mapping  tools  to  generate graphic displays of genetic maps.  Using the Linkage Maps  form,  you  can  generate  a graphical map display in either <EM>Encyclopedia</EM>  or  Web Map  format  to display  linkage  information  for  a  chromosome  from  a   particular cross. Centimorgan locations are specific to the cross and may  differ  from  estimates for the same loci found in MGD marker records. You can use the PostScript format option to generate a file for printing.

<H5>Cytogenetic Maps</H5> MGD stores  cytogenetic  band  information  for  mouse markers. The  Cytogenetic  Maps  query  form
provides  access  to map  images. Relatively few markers have been assigned cytogenetic locations.

<H5>Physical Maps</H5> As of June 1997, MGD stores physical  mapping  data  from MIT's mouse physical mapping project in which MIT
primers and STSs are mapped against a mouse YAC library to build a contig map of  the  mouse.  MGD  provides query access to the MIT primers, STSs  and  YACs.  In  addition,  MGD  provides integrated genetic/physical displays in Web Map  format.  These  map files are updated when the MIT mapping physical mapping  data  set  is  updated. <P> <p><EM><A NAME="ref"><B>References</B></A></EM> <BR>
MGD  contains  references  for all data in the  database.  As  of  February 1998,  MGD  contains  over  44,000 references. MGD
reference format is similar to that used by  MEDLINE.  Data  for the full MGD reference are extracted from MEDLINE when possible.
References  are first entered into MGD in an abbreviated format and these  records  are  updated when the MEDLINE records become
available. If the  journal  is  not  indexed  by MEDLINE, the full reference is manually entered into MGD.  (See  
<a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/reference_help.shtml#sort">details</A> on the content of reference records as displayed in query results.)

<P><EM><B>Chromosome Committee Reports</B></EM> <BR> The  <A  HREF="http://www.informatics.jax.org/ccr/">Chromosome Committee
Reports</A> were published annually (up to the year 2000) on the MGI web site. The  reports  provide  a consensus view on linkage information for each chromosome.  These  reports  are also the source for cM values for markers stored in MGD. <P>



<P> <H3>Mouse  Genome Sequence (MGS) Project</H3> The overall goal of the Mouse Genome Sequence  (MGS) project is to integrate emerging mouse genomic sequence data  with  the  genetic and biological data available in MGD and GXD. MGS is
part  of  the  informatics infrastructure needed to support mouse-human comparative genomics. The  specific aims of the project
include: <UL> <LI>Working cooperatively with sequencing centers and genome annotation groups to apply baseline sequence annotation to
mouse genomic sequence. <P> <LI>Implementing a  data integration process for connecting mouse genome sequence with existing
biological  knowledge. <P> <LI>Developing a web-based interface for querying and visualizing the results of the mouse genome
sequence annotation-integration process, including sequence alignments of mouse-human orthologs. </UL>

<P> The first tool released by MGS is a prototypic <A HREF="http://mouseblast.informatics.jax.org/">MouseBLAST</A> server
which enables you to compare a sequence of interest to a  database of  either mouse or rodent DNA or protein sequences. <p>
<H3>Encyclopedia  of the Mouse Genome (<EM>Encyclopedia</EM>)</H3> The <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> is a genetic  map-viewing application
that runs on a Macintosh computer. The <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> uses information retrieved from MGD to generate a graphic display of a
linkage map.  (<EM>See</EM> <A  HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgihome_url.html'-->/encyclopedia/encyclo.shtml">details</A> on the
