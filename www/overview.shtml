<p>MGD includes information on mouse genetic <a href="other/glossary.shtml#marker">markers</A>, molecular segments
(<a href="other/glossary.shtml#probe">probes</A>,
<a href="other/glossary.shtml#primer">primers</A> and
<a href="other/glossary.shtml#YAC">YACs</A>),
<a href="other/glossary.shtml#phenotype">phenotypes</A>, comparative mapping data, graphical displays of <a href="other/glossary.shtml#linkage_map">linkage</A>,
<a href="other/glossary.shtml#cytogenetic_map">cytogenetic</A> and
<a href="other/glossary.shtml#physical_map">physical maps</A>, experimental mapping data, as well as
 strain distribution patterns for <a href="other/glossary.shtml#recombinant_inbred">recombinant inbred
strains (RIs)</A> and cross <a href="other/glossary.shtml#haplotype">haplotypes</A>. Sources for
information in the database include  the scientific  literature,  DNA  mapping  panel  data produced by various researchers, the MIT Whitehead Institute (MIT genetic  and physical mapping data), WashU, and the  I.M.A.G.E.  consortium.  MGD  is  updated daily. Since it first became available on the WWW, MGD has continued to  evolve, expanding its data coverage, improving data handling, and providing new data manipulation and display tools.

<!--<P>MGD is integrated with the  Encyclopedia of the Mouse  Genome, a  
<A  HREF="other/glossary.shtml#genetic_map">genetic map</a> viewing
application for the Macintosh platform. You can configure Netscape to recognize the <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> as a "helper" application.
You can then  use the Linkage Maps query form to generate a linkage map in "<EM>Encyclopedia</EM>" format. The <EM>Encyclopedia</EM>
will automatically start up when  you  execute the search. The  resulting  map  displays  marker  symbols  arranged  along  the
chromosome. You can click on a marker and Netscape will search MGD and  retrieve the detail record for the selected marker for
display in a browser  window.  You can build an <EM>Encyclopedia</EM> linkage map using information from MGD marker records,
Chromosome Committee Reports,  MIT mouse  DNA  marker  maps,  and  DNA mapping panels.-->

<!--<P>Another format for map display is the "Web Map,"  a  type  of HTML file that provides a graphical display of cytogenetic and
linkage maps on a WWW browser page. The appearance is similar to that of a "PostScript"  map.  The marker symbols on the map are
linked to detail  marker  records  in  MGD.-->

<P><A NAME="mlc">Phenotype</A> records in  MGD have their origin in the
<a href="other/glossary.shtml#MLC">Mouse Locus Catalog (MLC)</A>, formerly an independent database. You can search for phenotype records using either the Genes and Markers query form or the Alleles and Phenotypes query form. You can search the MLC using the full-text searching capability of the Search tool which provides very reliable query  results. An integrated OMIM/MLC query form lets you enter one search string  to  execute  a  query  in  both  MLC  and  On-line  Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), a database maintained  by  the  National  Center  for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). 

<P>MGD is closely linked with the
Gene Expression Literature Index. The Gene Expression Literature Index is a collection  of  references  to  the  scientific literature reporting data on endogenous gene expression during mouse embryonic development. MGD provides links to Gene Expression Literature Index records through genetic marker detail records. The Gene Expression Literature Index provides links to MGD references  and  genetic  marker  records. 

<H4>MGD Data</H4>
<p>MGD is updated on  a  daily  basis  by  biologists  on  our curatorial
staff who scan the current scientific  literature,  extract  relevant data, and enter it in MGD. Increasingly, MGD acquires data
through large scale electronic transfer. Such data include mouse physical  mapping  data  downloaded from MIT, data generated by the collaborative efforts of WashU,  the  I.M.A.G.E. consortium, ATCC, and Mouse Genome Informatics. The data interface  is intended to be flexible and comprehensive so that each view of particular records in MGD provides links to any related data throughout MGD and, where possible, to  other databases on the Internet.

<P>Information on <B>alleles</B>, formerly imbedded in phenotype  descriptions, is stored as a separate data set. More information
on alleles will be available and accessible in MGD as time goes on. Links to alleles are provided in gene detail records. In
addition, there is an <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele_form.shtml">Alleles and Phenotypes Query Form</A> for  direct  queries against the allele data  set. (<I>See</I> <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/allele_help.shtml#detail">Phenotypic Alleles -- Query Results--Details</A> for the content of an allele record as displayed in query results.

<P>In addition, information on <A NAME="rflp">genetic polymorphisms</A> is extracted from probe/segment records in MGD. The
Polymorphisms Query Form enables you to search directly  for such information and display it. (See i
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/polymorphism_help.shtml#summary">Query Results -- Summary</a> and <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/polymorphism_help.shtml#detail">Query Results -- Details</A> for more information.)

<h4><A NAME="hom">Mammalian Homology</A></h4> 
MGD contains <a href="other/glossary.shtml#homology">homology</A> information for mouse, human and 15 other mammalian species. Most of the information  for homologies  is
extracted from the published scientific literature. In general,  these  papers  explicitly report homology relationships and MGD
reflects that published information. (<EM>See</EM> 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/homology_criteria.shtml">MGD Mammalian Homology Criteria</A> for the information used to establish homology.)

<P>An homology record shows the <a href="other/glossary.shtml#gene_symbol">symbol</A>, species, <a
href="other/glossary.shtml#chromosome">chromosome</A>,
<a href="other/glossary.shtml#cM">cM</A> position,
<a href="other/glossary.shtml#cytogenetic_band">cytogenetic band</A> and <a href="other/glossary.shtml#accession_ID">accession ID</A>
for each gene in the set of homologies. In addition, links to
other mammalian databases are provided where possible. MGD homology records may link to GDB, BovMap, PiGBASE, RATMAP, SheepBase, or ArkDB. 

<P> Every homology assertion is supported by one or more references.  The display of an homology reference includes the J number of
the reference, a short format citation, gene symbol and species. (<EM>See</EM> 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/homology_help.shtml#detail">Query Results -- Details</A> on
the content of a homology record as it appears in the query results.)

<P>  Homology information is presented in three other formats: Oxford Grid, comparative map and Homology Map View. An Oxford Grid
display presents an overview  of homology between two species. Currently, this kind of comparison  is supported  for  the following
species:  Mouse,  Human,  Cat,  Cattle,  Rat,  Pig,  Sheep. <P>  The comparative map display relies on the Linkage Map application to
build a graphic display of a map of a mouse chromosome (or chromosomal region)  which includes homologies from the comparison
species. See, for example, the comparative map for a 2 cM region around the mouse gene <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/linkmap.cgi?midpoint=52.3&cmrange=2&format=Web+Map&source=MGD&dsegments=0&syntenics=0&chromosome=1&species=2">Acrg</A> 
showing human homology.

<P> The Homology Map View displays the mouse genome as  the  consensus genetic map, with either human or rat orthologs labeled by
chromosome of origin and displayed next to  the  corresponding  segment  of  the  mouse  genome.  The Homology Map View is accessible
from the <A HREF="http://www.informatics.jax.org/menus/homology_menu.shtml">Homology Menu</A> page.

<h4><A NAME="map">Mapping Data</A></h4>
 MGD contains genetic mapping and linkage data, including haplotype data for
linkage crosses, recombinant inbred (RI) strain distribution patterns,
<a href="other/glossary.shtml#in_situ">in-situ hybridization</A> data, 
<a href="other/glossary.shtml#deletion">deletion</A> mapping
information, <a href="other/glossary.shtml#translocation">translocation</A> breakpoint mapping, somatic
cell hybrids, concordance tables, <a href="other/glossary.shtml#congenic">congenic strains</A> information, and physical mapping information.

<H4><A NAME="RIdata">Recombinant Inbred Strain Distribution Patterns Composite Data Set</A></H4> 
The RI Data portion of  MGD  mapping data records has been collected and organized into composite reports accessible using the 
Composite Recombinant Inbred Data Sets from MGD query form. The  information is displayed in tabular format with each COLUMN 
representing a strain  and  each ROW representing the distribution of alleles of a locus  across  these strains.

<H4><A NAME="RCdata">Recombinant Congenic Strain Distribution Patterns Composite Data Set</A></H4> Composite Recombinant Congenic
Strain Distribution Patterns data can be retrieved using a new query form accessed in the "Maps and  Mapping Data" section of MGD.
Information on four recombinant congenic  strain  sets  is currently available. Data include the progenitor strains for each  RCS
set  and tables showing the allelic distribution for each genetic marker that has been typed in each of the recombinant  congenic
strains.  Each  row  represents  the typing for a genetic marker and each column  represents  alleles  carried  by  a specific
recombinant congenic strain of the RCS set. Format of the report is very similar to that of the Composite Recombinant  Inbred
Strains  distribution patterns. <p> <p>For more information regarding the use of congenic  strains  to  analyze  traits controlled by multiple genes, see Peter Demant's paper, <BLOCKQUOTE>"Recombinant Congenic Strains - A New Tool for Analyzing Genetic Traits
Determined  by More Than One Gene, " Immunogenetics 24: 416-422, 1986.</BLOCKQUOTE> 
<p> 
<H4><A NAME="DNAdata">DNA Mapping Panel Data Sets </A> </H4> 
<p> Data  from the  major DNA mapping panels have been downloaded into MGD and are accessible through the DNA
Mapping Panel Data Sets from MGD query form and from the Linkage Maps  form. The data sets include: 
<ul> 
Copeland-Jenkins:(C57BL/6J x M. spretus)F1 x C57BL/6J <br>
EUCIB (BSB):(C57BL/6J x SPR or SEG/Pas)F1 x C57BL/6J<br>

UCLA (BSB): (C57BL/6J x M. spretus)F1 x C57BL/6J
</ul>

<p>DNA Mapping Panel data may appear in tabular format, where each column represents a single offspring of the cross, and each row indicates, for each locus,  which allele is present in each of the offspring. The order of rows is determined by linkage on the chromosome, and the locus nearest the centromere appears at the top of the display. Centimorgan locations for loci in the cross are determined by the provider of the cross. <P>

<H4>Mapping Experiment Records</H4> 
(<EM>See</EM> <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/mapping_data.shtml">Mapping Experimental Data Records</A> for information about the content of various mapping experiment records.)
<h4>Graphical Map Displays</h4>
<H5>Linkage  Maps</H5> 
Marker records in MGD include available information on genetic mapping locations from several sources: MGD, Chromosome Committees (up to the year 2000), and MIT. MGD provides  mapping  tools  to  generate graphic displays of genetic maps.  Using the Linkage Maps  form,  you  can  generate  a graphical map display in  Web Map  format  to display  linkage  information  for  a  chromosome  from  a  particular cross. Centimorgan locations are specific to the cross and may differ from  estimates for the same loci found in MGD marker records. You can print the display using the PostScript format option.

<H5>Cytogenetic Maps</H5> 
MGD stores  cytogenetic  band  information  for  mouse markers. The  Cytogenetic  Maps  query  form provides  access  to map  images. Relatively few markers have been assigned cytogenetic locations.

<H5>Physical Maps</H5> As of June 1997, MGD stores physical  mapping  data  from MIT's mouse physical mapping project in which MIT
primers and STSs are mapped against a mouse YAC library to build a contig map of  the  mouse.  MGD  provides query access to the MIT primers, STSs,  and  YACs.  In  addition,  MGD  provides integrated genetic/physical displays in Web Map format.  These  map files are updated when the MIT mapping physical mapping  data  set  is  updated. 

<h4><A NAME="ref">References</h4></A>
MGD  contains  references  for all data in the  database.  As of November 2002,  there were nearly 75,000 references. MGD reference format is similar to that used by  MEDLINE.  Data  for the full MGD reference are extracted from MEDLINE when possible. References are first entered into MGD in an abbreviated format; these  records  are  updated when the MEDLINE records become available. If the  journal  is  not indexed by MEDLINE, our curators enter the full reference into MGD manually.  (See  the References Query Form 
<a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/reference_help.shtml#detail">Query Results -- Detail</A> for more information about the content of reference records.)

<P><EM><B>Chromosome Committee Reports</B></EM> <BR> The  <A  HREF="http://www.informatics.jax.org/ccr/">Chromosome Committee
Reports</A> were published annually (up to the year 2000) on the MGI web site. The  reports provide  a consensus view on linkage information for each chromosome.  These reports were also the source for cM values for markers stored in MGD. <P>
