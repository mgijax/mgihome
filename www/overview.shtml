<p>The <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->">Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) Database</a> provides integrated access to data on the genetics, genomics and biology of the laboratory mouse. Contributing to this resource are:<P>
<ul>
<li><B>Mouse Genome Database (MGD) Project</B><BR>
MGD includes data on gene characterization, nomenclature, mapping, gene
homologies among mammals, sequences, phenotypes, allelic variants and
mutants, and strain data. (See</I> <A HREF="#aboutMGD">About MGD</A>.)

<li><B>Gene Expression Database (GXD) Project</B><BR>
GXD integrates different types of gene expression information from the mouse and provides a searchable index of published experiments on endogenous gene expression during development.  For details, see <A HREF="/GXD/aboutGXD.shtml">The Gene Expression Database (GXD)</A>.
<li>
<B>Mouse Genome Sequence (MGS) Project</B><BR>
 The goal of the MGS project is to integrate emerging mouse genomic sequence data
with the genetic and biological data available in MGD and GXD. MGS supports the MouseBLAST server as a sequence-level entry point into the MGI Database. (See</I> <A HREF="/MGS/mgs.shtml">The Mouse Genome Sequence Project</A>.)
<li><b>Gene Ontology (GO) Project</b><br>
The Mouse Genome Informatics group is a founding member of the Gene Ontology Consortium 
(www.geneontology.org). MGI fully incorporates the GO in the database and provides a 
GO browser. (See <a href="GO/project.shtml">The Gene Ontology (GO) Project</a>.)

<li><b>Mouse Tumor Biology (MTB) Database</b><br>
The goal of the <A HREF="http://tumor.informatics.jax.org/FMPro?-db=TumorInstance&-format=mtdp.html&-view">MTB</a> is to help researchers choose experimental models, review mutation patterns in specific cancers, and identify genes commonly mutated across a spectrum of cancers. The database currently holds over 10,000 tumor records. See <a href="http://tumor.informatics.jax.org/FMPro?-db=TumorInstance&-format=about_mtb.html&-findany">About the Mouse Tumor Biology Database</a>.

<h3><a name="aboutMGD"></a>About MGD</h3>
                                              
<p>MGD includes information on mouse genetic markers, molecular clones
probes,
primers and
YACs),
phenotypes, comparative mapping data, graphical displays of linkage,
cytogenetic and
physical maps, experimental mapping data, as well as
 strain distribution patterns for recombinant inbred
strains (RIs) and cross haplotypes. <!--Sources for
information in the database include the scientific  literature,  DNA  mapping  panel data produced by various researchers, the MIT Whitehead Institute (MIT genetic  and physical mapping data), WashU, and the  IMAGE  consortium.  --> Since it first became available on the web, MGD has continued to  evolve, expanding its data coverage, improving data handling, and providing new data manipulation and display tools. 

<P><A NAME="mlc"></A>Phenotype records in  MGD have their origin in the
Mouse Locus Catalog (MLC), formerly an independent database. You can search for phenotype records using either the Genes and Markers query form or the Alleles and Phenotypes query form. You can search the MLC using the full-text searching capability of the Search tool which provides very reliable query  results. An integrated OMIM/MLC query form lets you enter one search string  to  execute  a  query  in  both  MLC  and  On-line  Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), a database maintained  by  the  National  Center  for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). 

<P>MGD is closely linked with the
Gene Expression Literature Index. The Gene Expression Literature Index is a collection  of  references  to  the  scientific literature reporting data on endogenous gene expression during mouse embryonic development. MGD provides links to Gene Expression Literature Index records through genetic marker detail records. The Gene Expression Literature Index provides links to MGD references  and  genetic  marker  records. 

<H4>MGD Data</H4>
<p>MGD is updated on  a  daily  basis  by  biologists  on  our curatorial
staff who scan the current scientific  literature,  extract  relevant data, and enter it in MGD. Increasingly, MGD acquires data
through large scale electronic transfer. Such data include mouse physical  mapping  data  downloaded from MIT, data generated by the collaborative efforts of WashU,  the  IMAGE consortium, ATCC, and Mouse Genome Informatics. The data interface  is intended to be flexible and comprehensive so that each view of particular records in MGD provides links to any related data throughout MGD and, where possible, to  other databases on the Internet.

<P>MGD contains the following kinds  of information:
<P>
<UL>
Gene,
DNA marker,
QTL and
Cytogenetic marker descriptions<BR>
Mouse genetic phenotypes, genetic interrelationships, and polymorphic loci <BR> 
Mammalian orthology data <br>
Sequence data <BR> Molecular probes and clones(probes, clones, primers and YACs)<BR>
Genetic and physical mapping data<BR>
Polymorphic loci  related  to  specified strains  
<BR> Information on inbred strains</A> (M. Festing's listing)<BR>
References supporting  all  data  in MGD <BR> 
</UL>

<P><b>Data Links to <a href="other/collab_and_acknow.shtml">External Databases</A></b>

<P>MGD  provides links  to  relevant  information  in   external databases wherever possible.  Through markers, MGD links to EC, DoTS, UniGene, ENSEMBL, TIGR, LocusLink, InterPro, and PDB. Through orthologies,  MGD links  to GDB, PigBase, SheepBase, BovMap and RATMAP. Through molecular probes and clones,  MGD links to GenBank, EMBL, and DDBJ. Through references, MGD links to PubMed. 

<h4><A NAME="mkr">Genes and Markers</A></h4>
MGD contains information on mouse genes, DNA segments,
cytogenetic markers and QTLs. Each record may include the marker symbol, name,other names or symbols and synonyms, nomenclature history, alleles, STSs, 
chromosomal assignment, centimorgan location,
cytogenetic band, EC number (for enzymes), phenotypic classifications, 
Gene Ontology (GO) terms, MGI  accession IDs and supporting references. (See 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/marker_help.shtml#summary">Summary</a> and <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/marker_help.shtml#detail">Details</a> for more information about the content of the display of a marker record as it appears in the query results.)

<P>Information on <B>alleles</B>, formerly imbedded in phenotype  descriptions, is stored as a separate data set. More information
on alleles will be available and accessible in MGD as time goes on. Links to alleles are provided in gene detail records. In
addition, there is an <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele_form.shtml">Alleles and Phenotypes Query Form</A> for  direct  queries against the allele data  set. (See <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/allele_help.shtml#detail">Details</A> for the content of an allele record as displayed in query results.

<h4><A NAME="pro"></A>Molecular Probes and Clones</h4>
 <P>MGD contains information on probes,
clones, 
primers,
YACs, and 
STSs. 
Information may include the origin of the probe/clone, sequence, 
vector type, 
hybridizing loci, 
RFLPs, and references. (<EM>See</EM> the Probes Query Form 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/probe_help.shtml#summary">Summary</A> and <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/probe_help.shtml#detail">Details</A> for more information about the content of a probe/clone record as it appears in the query results.)

<P>In addition, information on <A NAME="rflp">genetic polymorphisms</A> is extracted from probe/clone records in MGD. The
Polymorphisms Query Form enables you to search directly  for such information and display it. (See 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/polymorphism_help.shtml#summary">Summary</a> and <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/polymorphism_help.shtml#detail">Details</A> for more information.)



<h4><A NAME="hom">Mammalian Orthology</A></h4> 
MGD contains orthology information for mouse, human and 15 other mammalian organisms. Most of the information for orthologies  is
extracted from the published scientific literature. In general, these papers explicitly report orthology relationships and MGD reflects that published information. (<EM>See</EM> 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/homology_criteria.shtml">MGD Mammalian Orthology Criteria</A> for the information used to establish orthology.)

<P>An orthology record shows the symbol, organism, chromosome,
cM position,
cytogenetic band and accession ID
for each gene in the set of orthologies. In addition, links to
other mammalian databases are provided where possible. MGD orthology records may link to GDB, BovMap, PiGBASE, RATMAP, SheepBase, or ArkDB. 

<P> Every orthology assertion is supported by one or more references.  The display of an orthology reference includes the J number of the reference, a short format citation, gene symbol, and organism. (<EM>See</EM> <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/homology_help.shtml#detail">Details</A> on
the content of an orthology record as it appears in the query results.)

<P>Orthology information is presented in three other formats: Oxford Grid, comparative map and Orthology Map View. An Oxford Grid display presents an overview of orthology between two organisms. Currently, this kind of comparison  is supported for the following organisms:  Mouse, Human, Cat, Cattle, Rat, Pig, Sheep. 

<P>The comparative map display relies on the Linkage Map application to build a graphic display of a map of a mouse chromosome (or chromosomal region) which includes orthologies from the comparison organisms. See, for example, the comparative map for a 2 cM region around the mouse gene 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/accession_report.cgi?id=MGI:87895">Chrng</A> showing human orthology.
<P> The Orthology Map View displays the mouse genome as the consensus genetic map, with either human or rat orthologs labeled by chromosome of origin and displayed next to the corresponding  segment of the mouse genome.  The Orthology Map View is accessible
from the <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->menus/homology_menu.shtml">Orthology Menu</A> page.

<h4><A NAME="sequence">Sequence Data</h4>
<P>Vast amounts of sequence data are integrated with the biological information in MGD. All mouse sequences from GenBank, RefSeq, Swiss-Prot, DoTS, and the TIGR and NIA mouse gene indices enable powerful queries from the <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->/searches/sequence_form.shtml">Mouse Sequence Query Form</a>. Users can query by attributes, such as sequence length and provider, and also by information MGI has about the clones the sequences were derived from, 
and the genes the sequence have been associated to. Because of the curated associations between mouse markers and sequences, users can search for sequences by information about these markers including nomenclature, map position, function 
(GO annotations and InterPro domains), expression (tissue and developmental 
stage), and phenotypes of mutant alleles. Source information about the clones that the sequences are derived from, such as strain, tissue, or library, is carefully translated into controlled vocabularies.  This adds enormouse power to sequence queries, since authors often use multiple terms to specify a strain or tissue.  </P>


<h4><A NAME="map">Mapping Data</A></h4>
 MGD contains genetic mapping and linkage data, including haplotype data for
linkage crosses, recombinant inbred (RI) strain distribution patterns,
in-situ hybridization data, 
deletion mapping
information, translocation breakpoint mapping, somatic
cell hybrids, concordance tables, congenic strains information, and physical mapping information.

<H4><A NAME="RIdata">Recombinant Inbred Strain Distribution Patterns Composite Data Set</A></H4> 
The RI Data portion of  MGD  mapping data records has been collected and organized into composite reports accessible using the 
Composite Recombinant Inbred Data Sets from MGD query form. The  information is displayed in tabular format with each COLUMN 
representing a strain  and  each ROW representing the distribution of alleles of a locus  across  these strains.

<H4><A NAME="RCdata">Recombinant Congenic Strain Distribution Patterns Composite Data Set</A></H4> Composite Recombinant Congenic
Strain Distribution Patterns data can be retrieved using a new query form accessed in the "Maps and  Mapping Data" section of MGD.
Information on four recombinant congenic  strain  sets  is currently available. Data include the progenitor strains for each  RCS
set  and tables showing the allelic distribution for each genetic marker that has been typed in each of the recombinant  congenic
strains.  Each  row  represents  the typing for a genetic marker and each column  represents  alleles  carried  by  a specific
recombinant congenic strain of the RCS set. Format of the report is very similar to that of the Composite Recombinant Inbred
Strains  distribution patterns. 
<p>For more information regarding the use of congenic  strains  to  analyze  traits controlled by multiple genes, see Peter Demant's paper, <BLOCKQUOTE>"Recombinant Congenic Strains - A New Tool for Analyzing Genetic Traits
Determined  by More Than One Gene, " Immunogenetics 24: 416-422, 1986.</BLOCKQUOTE> 
<p> 
<H4><A NAME="DNAdata">DNA Mapping Panel Data Sets </A> </H4> 
<p> Data  from the  major DNA mapping panels have been downloaded into MGD and are accessible through the DNA
Mapping Panel Data Sets from MGD query form and from the Linkage Maps  form. The data sets include: 
<ul> 
Copeland-Jenkins:(C57BL/6J x M. spretus)F1 x C57BL/6J <br>

</ul>

<p>DNA Mapping Panel data may appear in tabular format, where each column represents a single offspring of the cross, and each row indicates, for each locus,  which allele is present in each of the offspring. The order of rows is determined by linkage on the chromosome, and the locus nearest the centromere appears at the top of the display. Centimorgan locations for loci in the cross are determined by the provider of the cross. <P>

<H4>Mapping Experiment Records</H4> 
(<EM>See</EM> <A HREF="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/mapping_data.shtml">Mapping Experimental Data Records</A> for information about the content of various mapping experiment records.)
<h4>Graphical Map Displays</h4>
<H5>Linkage  Maps</H5> 
Marker records in MGD include available information on genetic mapping locations from several sources: MGD, Chromosome Committees (up to the year 2000), and MIT. MGD provides  mapping  tools  to  generate graphic displays of genetic maps.  Using the Linkage Maps  form,  you  can  generate  a graphical map display in  Web Map  format  to display  linkage  information  for  a  chromosome  from  a  particular cross. Centimorgan locations are specific to the cross and may differ from  estimates for the same loci found in MGD marker records. You can print the display using the PostScript format option.

<H5>Cytogenetic Maps</H5> 
MGD stores  cytogenetic  band  information  for  mouse markers. The  Cytogenetic  Maps  query  form provides  access  to map  images. Relatively few markers have been assigned cytogenetic locations.

<H5>Physical Maps</H5> As of June 1997, MGD stores physical  mapping  data  from MIT's mouse physical mapping project in which MIT
primers and STSs are mapped against a mouse YAC library to build a contig map of  the  mouse.  MGD  provides query access to the MIT primers, STSs,  and  YACs.  In  addition,  MGD  provides integrated genetic/physical displays in Web Map format.  These  map files are updated when the MIT mapping physical mapping  data  set  is  updated. 

<h4><A NAME="ref">References</h4></A>
MGD  contains  references  for all data in the  database.  As of December 2003,  there were nearly 85,000 references. MGD reference format is similar to that used by  PubMed.  Data  for the full MGD reference are extracted from PubMed when possible. References are first entered into MGD in an abbreviated format; these  records  are  updated when the PubMed records become available. If the  journal  is  not indexed by PubMed, our curators enter the full reference into MGD manually.  (See  the References Query Form 
<a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->userdocs/reference_help.shtml#detail">Detail</A> for more information about the content of reference records.)

<P><EM><B>Chromosome Committee Reports</B></EM> <BR> The  <A  HREF="http://www.informatics.jax.org/ccr/">Chromosome Committee
Reports</A> were published annually (until 2000) on the MGI web site. The  reports provide  a consensus view on linkage information for each chromosome.  These reports were also the source for cM values for markers stored in MGD. <P>
