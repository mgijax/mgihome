		<p>The Phenotypes, Alleles &amp; Disease Models project in MGI enables comparative phenotype analysis, searches for human disease
		models, and hypothesis generation by providing access to spontaneous, induced, and genetically engineered mutations and their
		strain-specific phenotypes.</p>

		<span class="enhance">Alleles</span>

		<p>A primary objective for MGI is the maintenance of a complete catalog of phenotypic mutations in the laboratory mouse. These include
		spontaneous, induced, and genetically engineered mutations (targeted knockouts and conditionals, transgenics, Cre-constructs, targeted
		reporters, gene traps, transposon-induced mutations, etc.).</p>

		<p>MGI serves as the international authoritative source for nomenclature for mouse alleles, and maintains a complete list of
		allele symbols, names, and synonyms, each with a unique accession ID. Researchers are encouraged to <a href="<!--#include file='include/mgihome_url.html'-->submissions/amsp_submission.cgi">submit new alleles</a> to reserve symbols
		and obtain accession IDs prior to publication.</p>

		<p>Alleles can be searched within MGI by name or symbol, category (e.g. targeted knockout), genome location, associated phenotypes and
		disease models using the <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele_form.shtml">Phenotypes, Alleles &amp; Disease Models Query
		Form</a> and a complete listing of alleles can be downloaded from the ftp
		site (<a href="<!--#include file='include/ftp_url2.html'-->reports/index.html#pheno">http://www.informatics.jax.org/downloads/reports/index.html#pheno</a>).</p>

		<span class="enhance">Phenotypes</span>

		<p>Phenotypes are the manifestation of an individual's genotype in its environment. In the most straightforward case, phenotypic effects
		of allelic mutations are observed in relation to a control strain background; and the environment within the observing laboratory is
		considered constant.</p>

		<p>Complications quickly expand when considering complex, multi-genic mutations, conditional and tissue-specific allele
		ablation, the combination of mutations in multiple genes in a single animal, the use of multiple strain backgrounds on which mutations are
		created and/or transferred, and the experimental application of additional environmental variables that can heighten or lessen
		phenotypic outcome. To maximize the usefulness of these complex data, phenotypes in MGI are associated with specific genotypes (combinations
		of allelic mutations on specific genetic backgrounds).</p>

		<p>Phenotypes are described in MGI using the <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/MP_form.shtml">Mammalian Phenotype
		Ontology</a>, a structured vocabulary that allows consistent annotation of mouse genotypes with standard phenotype terminology and associates
		each piece of phenotypic data with its source (e.g., published literature, large-scale mutagenesis centers, individual research
		laboratories).</p>

		<p>The <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele_form.shtml">Phenotypes, Alleles &amp; Disease Models Query Form</a> allows
		users to ask broad or specific questions about phenotypes of specific mutations or search genome-wide for all genotypes what produce one or
		a combination of phenotypes.</p>


		<span class="enhance">QTL</span>

		<p>QTL are quantitative trait loci, defined by the association of phenotypic characteristics with chromosomal regions. Generally many
		such loci contribute to quantitative characters, such as body metrics (e.g., length, adiposity), substance preference/aversion (e.g., to
		alcohol, cocaine), autoimmunity and susceptibility to infection, etc. Recently some QTL have been identified with their underlying genes.
		MGI captures information on strain-specific QTL variants, including genome location, descriptions of mapping analysis and significance
		scores, and descriptions of phenotypes using Mammalian Phenotype Ontology terms. QTL can be searched in the same way as other
		phenotypic alleles.</p>

		<span class="enhance">Models of Human Disease</span>

		<p>The primary goal of MGI is to facilitate the use of mouse as a model for human biology and disease. Mouse genotypes that have been
		used to study specific human diseases are curated in MGI using disease terms found in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (<a href="http://www.omim.org/">OMIM</a>). Within
		MGI, users can browse for a specific human disease term using the
		<a href="<!--#include file='include/java_url.html'-->WIFetch?page=omimVocab&subset=A">Human Disease Vocabulary Browser</a> and follow links to either the OMIM
		human disease record, or to the MGI page providing human disease and mouse model details.</p>
		
		<p>The <a href="<!--#include file='include/mgihome_url.html'-->homepages/humanDisease.shtml">Human&mdash;Mouse: Disease Connection</a> site provides a path into mouse genetic and comparative data from the human or mouse perspective. Users can begin to explore data by searching for genes (symbols, names, IDs) or genome locations from human or mouse, or by searching with mouse phenotype or human disease terms. Searching also can be done using VCF file input for human or mouse data.</p>

		<p>In addition, one can use the <a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/allele_form.shtml">Phenotypes, Alleles &amp; Disease
		Models Query Form</a> to search for diseases in combination with specifying one or more mouse phenotype terms and/or limiting one's search to
		specific categories of mutant alleles and/or specific genome regions.</p>

		<p>All allele, phenotype, and human disease model data are fully integrated with the rich genetic, genomic, and biological data in MGI.</p>
