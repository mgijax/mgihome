<title>MGI-Mouse Functional Annotation using the Gene Ontology (GO) : Curation - Functional Annotation using the Gene Ontology (GO): Interpreting Annotations</title>
</head>

<p> MGI assigns GO annotation by either manual curation of published  experimental literature or automated electronic-based methods.
The  annotated records include the supporting references. MGI collaborates  with several groups outside of MGI in collecting GO
annotation for  mouse genes. See <a href="<!--#include file='include/mgihome_url.html'-->GO/go_curators.shtml">GO Curators</a> for the
list of groups that provide  annotations for mouse genes.</p>
<p>Electronic-based annotation strategies include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>mapping the Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers associated with a gene  to the EC number attached to GO terms (referenced with J:72245)</li>
  <li>translating SWISS-PROT &quot;keywords&quot; associated with a gene to appropriate GO terms (referenced with J:60000)</li>
  <li>mapping InterPro domains associated with a gene to GO terms (referenced with J:72247)</li>
  <li>reviewed computational alanysis (RCA) performed by the Riken consortium (attributed to MGI reference J:80000)</li>
</ul>
