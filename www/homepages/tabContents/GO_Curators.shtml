			<p> MGI assigns GO annotation by either manual curation of published  experimental literature or automated
			electronic-based methods. The  annotated records include the supporting references. MGI collaborates
			with several groups outside of MGI in collecting GO annotation for  mouse genes. See
			<a href="<!--#include file="include/mgihome_url.html"-->GO/go_curators.shtml">GO Curators</a> for the list
			of groups that provide  annotations for mouse genes.</p>
			<p>Electronic-based annotation strategies include:</p>
			<ul id="help">
				<li>mapping the Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers associated with a gene  to the EC number attached to
				GO terms (referenced with J:72245)</li>
				<li>translating SWISS-PROT &quot;keywords&quot; associated with a gene to appropriate GO terms
				(referenced with J:60000)</li>
				<li>mapping InterPro domains associated with a gene to GO terms (referenced with J:72247)</li>
				<li>associating GO terms to a gene, based upon proper gene nomenclature (referenced with J:56000).
				<ul>
					<li>For example, G-protein linked receptor activity genes can be annotated as:
						<ul>
							<li>Molecular Function: G protein linked receptor</li>
							<li>Cellular Component: integral to plasma membrane</li>
							<li>Biological Process: G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>reviewed computational alanysis (RCA) performed by the Riken consortium (attributed to MGI reference J:80000)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you have questions, need assistance, or wish to report a problem  with
			specific annotations, please contact MGI at  mgi-help@informatics.jax.org.</p>
