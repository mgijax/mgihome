 		Collaborators  and Large-scale Data Providers:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.emouseatlas.org/" class="GO">EMAP</a> (Edinburgh  Mouse Atlas Project) and <a href="http://www.emouseatlas.org/emage/" class="GO">EMAGE</a> (Edinburgh Mouse Atlas Gene Expression Database)</li>
		</ul>
  		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; GXD uses the Anatomical Dictionary of Mouse Development
  		developed by EMAP to describe expression patterns in standardized ways.
  		&nbsp; GXD helps to refine the anatomical  dictionary by providing
  		continuous feedback.&nbsp; GXD also provides its RNA in situ and
  		Immunohistochemistry data to EMAGE,  so that the data can be spatially
  		mapped.&nbsp;  The ultimate goal of our collaboration is to provide the
  		scientific  community with integrated access to text-based and graphical
  		expression data via the
  		<a href="<!--#include file='include/mgihome_url.html'-->GXD/gxdgen.shtml" class="GO">Mouse Gene Expression Information Resource.</a>
  		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.genepaint.org/Frameset.html" class="GO">GenePaint  Database</a></li>
		</ul>
  		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have incorporated in situ hybridization  data from
  		GenePaint into GXD.&nbsp; This data  set can be viewed at
  		<a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/reference.cgi?124081" class="GO">J:122989</a>.
  		&nbsp; Database entries in GXD link to the  corresponding entries in GenePaint.&nbsp;
  		In  this way, users can take advantage of GXD&rsquo;s data integration and querying
  		capabilities while having easy access to GenePaint&rsquo;s high-resolution images and
  		zoom capabilities.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have incorporated RNA <i>in situ</i> hybridization data from Eurexpress into GXD.  This data set can be viewed at 
<a href="<!--#include file='include/wi_url.html'-->searches/reference.cgi?154591 class="GO">J:153498</a>.&nbsp;  Database entries in GXD link to the corresponding entries in Eurexpress.  In this way, users can take advantage of GXD's data integration and querying capabilities while having easy access to Eurexpress's high-resolution images and zoom capabilities.</p>

  		<p>We have also incorporated data from the following major studies:</p>
