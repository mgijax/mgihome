      <p>The availability of the complete genome sequence for the laboratory 
      mouse provides a powerful platform for predicting genes and  other 
      genome features. However, building a catalog of genome annotations is 
      just the beginning for biology in a &ldquo;post-genome&rdquo; era. To 
      derive new insights  into fundamental biological processes using complete 
      genome sequences will  require understanding how genome features interact 
      in pathways and networks in  the cell and how perturbations of these 
      interactions contribute to disease processes.&nbsp; Toward this end, we 
      have implemented a new  database of curated biochemical pathways for the 
      laboratory mouse called  MouseCyc. </p>
      <p>The MouseCyc database represents a significant advance for biomedical 
      researchers wanting to access mouse genetic and genomic  data in the 
      context of physiological and cellular processes. The initial focus for 
      the development of MouseCyc is on metabolism and includes such cell level 
      processes as biosynthesis, degradation, energy production, and 
      detoxification. MouseCyc differs from existing pathway databases and 
      software tools because of the extent to which the pathway  information 
      in MouseCyc is integrated with the wealth of biological knowledge for 
      the laboratory mouse that is available from the Mouse Genome Informatics 
      (MGI)  database.</p>
      <p>MouseCyc is supported by NIH HG003622.</p>
