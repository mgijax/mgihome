			<p>Much data in MGI relates to the C57BL/6J reference strain, MGI contains other strain information including:
			<ul>
				<li>Strain distribution patterns for recombinant inbred  (RI) and recombinant congenic (RC) strains and cross
				haplotypes</li>
				<li>Polymorphic loci  related  to  specified strains</li>
				<li>SNPs and other sequence polymorphisms in one strain or differences between many strains</li>
				<li>Information on inbred strains (M. Festing's listing)</li>
				<li>Phenotypic characteristics of strains and of mutant alleles on a variety of  genetic background strains</li>
				<li>Information about the strains of clones from which sequences are derived</li>
