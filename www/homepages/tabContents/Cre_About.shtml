<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Cre is currently the most commonly used recombinase. It catalyzes site-specific recombination of DNA between loxP sites, thus making possible conditional mutagenesis, where specific genes can be knocked out in particular tissues and at particular developmental time points. Other non-cre recombinases (such as Flp, Dre, phiC31, etc.) and various inducible forms of recombinases have been and are being developed. We are curating data about all recombinase-containing transgenes and knock-ins developed in mice to provide a comprehensive resource delineating known activity patterns and allowing users to find relevant mouse resources for their studies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Available data will continue to increase. To retrieve all recombinase-containing transgenes and knock-in alleles, use R<small>ETRIEVE</SMALL> A<SMALL>LL</SMALL> A<SMALL>LLELES</SMALL>, above. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>The Recombinase Activity project is funded by NIH grants OD011190 and HD062499.</td></tr>
