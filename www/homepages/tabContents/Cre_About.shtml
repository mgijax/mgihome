</head>

<body>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Cre is currently the most commonly used recombinase. It catalyzes site-specific recombination of DNA between loxP sites, thus making possible conditional mutagenesis, where specific genes can be knocked out in particular tissues and at particular developmental time points. Other recombinases, such as Flp and Dre and various inducible forms of recombinases, have been and are being developed. MGI is curating data about all recombinase-containing transgenes and knock-ins developed in mouse to provide a comprehensive resource delineating known specificity patterns and allowing users to find relevant mouse resources for their studies.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>The Recombinase Specificity project at MGI is funded by NIH grants HG000330 and HD033745 and EU grant HEALTH-F4-2009-223487.</td></tr>
