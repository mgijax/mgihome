		<p>MGI contains homology information for mouse, human, cattle, chick and other vertebrate
		organisms.  A homology record shows the symbol, organism, chromosome,
		cM position, cytogenetic band, and accession ID for each gene in the vertebrate homology class. Available links to other resources appear as well (e.g.,
		Entrez Gene, HGNC, Gene Tree, OMIM). See <a href="<!--#include file="include/userhelp_url.html"-->HOMOLOGY_class_help.shtml">Interpreting Vertebrate Homology Class Reports</a> for more detail.</p>

		<p>MGI loads sequence based vertebrate homology assertions from NCBI <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/homologene">HomoloGene</a>. HomoloGene programmatically detects homologs among the genome features of several completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes. 
			In addition, we continue to work with the research community to carefully curate gene family sets, 
			usually at the instigation of the research community. </p>

		<!--<p>Orthology information is presented in other formats: comparative map and
		Orthology Map View. 
		
		<p> The Orthology Map View displays the mouse genome as the consensus  genetic map, with either human or
		rat orthologs labeled by chromosome  of origin and displayed next to the corresponding segment of the mouse
		genome. </p> -->
