 <tr>
  <td>The Gene Expression Database (GXD) collects and integrates the gene expression information in MGI.
	<ul id="help">
	 <li>GXD collects data from the following assay types: RNA in situ hybridization; Immunohistochemistry; in situ reporter (knock in); RT-PCR; Northern and Western blots.</li>
     <li>All data entered into GXD is reviewed by our team of experienced curators with PhDs.</li>
     <li>It is our curatorial policy to annotate expression patterns based solely on what is written in the manuscript; we do not interpret images presented within papers. We are happy to accept more detailed descriptions of expression patterns from authors and will update database entries accordingly.</li>
     <li>GXD focuses on endogenous gene expression data in wild-type and mutant mice, including reporter data from knock-in experiments. Currently GXD does not include expression data from other types of transgenic animals, conditional knock-outs, chimeras, animals subjected to treatments, or from cultured material.</li>
     <li>When we have permission from publishers or providers we include images. All images are displayed with citation information and with copyright.</li>
