			The Gene Expression Database (GXD) collects and integrates the gene
			expression information in MGI.
			<ul id="help">
				<li>GXD's  primary emphasis is on endogenous gene expression during
				mouse development. </li><br />
				<li>Data are acquired from the literature by our curatorial staff
				and via direct submission from large-scale data providers, as well
				as individual labs.  New expression data are made available on a
				daily basis.</li><br />
				<li>GXD currently collects detailed expression data from the
				following assay types: RNA in situ hybridization; Immunohistochemistry;
				in situ reporter (knock in); RT-PCR; Northern and Western blots;
				and RNase and Nuclease S1 protection assays</li><br />
				<li>It is our curatorial policy to annotate expression patterns
				based solely on what is written in the manuscript; we do not
				interpret images presented within papers. We are happy to accept
				more detailed descriptions of expression patterns from authors
				and will update database entries accordingly.</li><br />
				<li>GXD focuses on endogenous gene expression data in wild-type
				and mutant mice, including reporter data from knock-in experiments.
				Currently GXD does not include expression data from other types of
				transgenic animals, conditional knock-outs, chimeras, animals
				subjected to treatments, or from cultured material.</li><br />
