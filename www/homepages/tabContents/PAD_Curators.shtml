		<strong>How we make allele lab code assignments</strong>
			<ul>
				<p>If lab codes are not assigned in the original publication of  an allele, the lab code of the
				corresponding author of that paper is used.&nbsp; However, if the original paper clearly  indicates
				that another laboratory is responsible for creation and maintenance  of this mutation, the lab code
				for the laboratory creating the mutant mice will  be used.&nbsp; Further, lab codes for alleles
				will be corrected if later correspondence with the authors of the original  paper indicate that
				another code would be more appropriate. If the person  responsible for creating and maintaining the
				mutation does not have a lab code  we will register one with
				<a href="http://dels-old.nas.edu/ilar_n/ilarhome/labcode.shtml">ILAR</a>
				(http://dels-old.nas.edu/ilar_n/ilarhome/labcode.shtml)  for them.</p>
			</ul>
		<strong>How we determine genetic background</strong>
			<ul>
				<p>Genetic background is determined from information in the publication being
				annotated as well as strain of origin information in prior references for the alleles involved.  For targeted
				or gene-trapped mutations, the strain of origin is the strain or strains from which the ES cells used were
				derived.  For transgenes, the strain of origin is the strain or strains of the one cell embryos injected.  For
				chemical, radiation, and transposon induced mutations the strain of origin is all strains involved in the
				crosses used to generate the line.</p>
				<p>Congenic nomenclature is used when the mice described have been backcrossed 5 or more generations to
				an inbred strain (incipient congenics). Coisogenic nomenclature is used when mice have only been crossed
				to the same strain as the strain of origin or if previously crossed to a different strain backcrossed 5
				or more generations to the same strain as the strain of origin.</p>
				<p>Mice on mixed or partially defined backgrounds are described as &quot;involves: strain1 * strain
				2 ...&quot;.  Mixed strain backgrounds include the strains from all relevant crosses described in the
				publication including crosses to cre-expressing mice even if the cre allele is subsequently bred out
				of the mice. The list of strains following "involves:" may be not include all strains in the actual
				mouse line. If specific alternative crosses are reported, the background is &quot;either: option1 or
				option2&quot;. </p>
				<p>If no background information is offered and cannot be deduced from information already reported
				for the alleles used, the background is &quot;Not Specified&quot;.</p>
			</ul>
		<strong>How we make disease associations</strong>
			<ul>
				<p>Disease associations are based on  author statements in the publication being annotated. Annotations
				to Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) vocabulary terms are only made when each disease, syndrome,
				or condition in the publication unambiguously matches only a single OMIM term. However, a mouse may be a
				model for more than one disease. When a human disease or condition can not be matched to an OMIM term the
				model association is listed in the general notes section of the page.</p>
			</ul>
		<strong>Why we list some notes beginning with &quot;Background sensitivity&quot;</strong>
			<ul>
				<p>When a publication indicates that a phenotype differs significantly based on the strain background of
				the mouse we label the note as "background sensitivity".</p>
			</ul>
		<strong>How we annotate &quot;normal&quot; phenotypes</strong>
			<ul>
				<p>If no publication has found any abnormal phenotypes for a mutation this is annotated as "no abnormal
				phenotype detected".  Otherwise unexpected normal phenotypes are annotated in the appropriate system. These
				annotations may be made to the highest level Mammalian Phenotype term for the system or as a note attached
				to a lower level abnormal term that is related to the normal phenotype. We only include unexpected normal
				phenotypes which are those where there was some reason to expect an abnormality.</p>
