			<p>Homology information in MGD is extracted from the scientific literature. This information includes the
			type of experimental evidence used to support homology assertions. Now, MGD homology query results indicate
			the criteria for homology assertions. Some homologies are reported by a number of sources. There can be a
			number of different criteria shown for the same set of homologs. See, for example, the homology report on
			the Cftr gene. You will see a new Criteria column on the right showing, in this example, several values,
			AA (Amino acid sequence comparison), CL (Conserved map location) and NT (Nucleotide sequence comparison).</p>
			<p>You will also see the Number of References associated with each criterion. The number is linked to the
			references. Beneath the tabular display of a set of homologies, the References line now provides options to
			view a list of either all the references for a set of homologies, or, view the references for particular
			species represented in the set.</p>
