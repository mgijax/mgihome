			<p><strong>About MGI's Orthologies</strong></p><ul>
			<p>MGD provides a curated set of mammalian orthologs for the research community. Although MGD supports
			orthology annotations to over 20 mammalian genomes, the priority effort focuses on the creation of
			orthology sets among mouse, human and rat. This set is constructed through an iterative process using
			both computational and manual approaches. We work with the HomoloGene resource at the NCBI to incorporate
			some of the HomoloGene computational three-way reciprocal best-hit sets into the MGI system. HomoloGene
			incorporates MGD-curated mammalian orthology sets in their resources. In addition, we continue to work
			with the research community to carefully curate gene family sets, usually at the instigation of the
			research community.</p>
