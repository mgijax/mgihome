			<p>MGI provides a curated set of vertebrate homologs for the 
			research community. MGI focuses on integration of homology 
			sets from sequenced vertebrate genomes (e.g., human, rat, dog, chimp).  
			MGI loads sequence based vertebrate homology assertions from NCBI <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/homologene">HomoloGene</a>. HomoloGene programmatically detects homologs among the genome features of several completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes. MGI also uses HGNC/HCOP data for human and mouse orthology. In addition, we continue to work with the research community to carefully curate gene family sets, usually at the instigation of the research community. </p>
