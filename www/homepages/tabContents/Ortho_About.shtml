			<p>MGI provides a curated set of mammalian orthologs for the 
			research community. MGI focuses on integration of orthology 
			sets from sequenced mammalian genomes (e.g., human, rat, dog, chimp).  
			This set is constructed through an iterative process using both 
			computational and manual approaches. We work with the HomoloGene 
			resource at the NCBI to incorporate some of the HomoloGene 
			computational three-way reciprocal best-hit sets into the MGI 
			system. HomoloGene incorporates MGI-curated mammalian orthology 
			sets in their resources. In addition, we continue to work with 
			the research community to carefully curate gene family sets, 
			usually at the instigation of the research community. </p>
