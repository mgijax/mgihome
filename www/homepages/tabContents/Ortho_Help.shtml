		<p>MGI contains orthology information for mouse, human and 15 other  mammalian organisms. Most of the
		information for orthologies extracted  from the published scientific literature. In general, these
		papers  explicitly report orthology relationships and MGI reflects that  published information. See
		the <em>Evidence</em> section under
		<a href="<!--#include file="include/userdocs_url.html"-->homology_summary.shtml#fields">How do I
		interpret the results of my query?</a> in <em>Interpreting Mammalian Orthology Query Results</em>
		for the criteria used to establish orthology.</p>
		<p>An orthology record shows the symbol, organism, chromosome, cM  position, cytogenetic band, and
		accession ID for each gene in the set  of orthologies. In addition, when there are available links
		to other  mammalian databases, these appear as well (e.g., Ark-DB, BovMap,  Entrez, HGNC, Homologene,
		NCBI, PigBase, SheepBase, TreeFam, Uniprot,  VEGA, VISTA).</p>
		<p>Every orthology assertion is supported by one or more references.  The display of an orthology
		reference includes the J number of the  reference, a short format citation, gene symbol, and organism.
		See <a href="<!--#include file="include/userdocs_url.html"-->homology_summary.shtml#contain">What's in
		a Mammalian Ortholology Query Results report?</a> for more detail.</p>
		<p>Orthology information is presented in three other formats: Oxford  Grid, comparative map and
		Orthology Map View. An Oxford Grid display  presents an overview of orthology between two organisms.
		Currently,  this kind of comparison is supported for the following organisms:  mouse, human, cat, cattle,
		rat, pig, sheep, dog, chimp.</p>
		<p>The comparative map display relies on the Linkage Map application to  build a graphic display of a
		map of a mouse chromosome (or chromosomal  region) which includes orthologies from the comparison organisms.
		See,  for example, the comparative map for a 2 cM region around the mouse  gene
		<a href="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->searches/accession_report.cgi?id=MGI:87895">Chrng</a>
		showing human orthology.</p>
		<p> The Orthology Map View displays the mouse genome as the consensus  genetic map, with either human or
		rat orthologs labeled by chromosome  of origin and displayed next to the corresponding segment of the mouse
		genome. The Orthology Map View is accessible from the
		<a href="<!--#include file="include/wi_url.html"-->menus/allsearch_menu.shtml#ortho">Mammalian Orthology</a>
		section of the All Search Tools page, or the Mammalian Orthology section of the Search menu.</p>
