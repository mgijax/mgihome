<br><center><h3>Process for prioritizing genes to be knocked out in KOMP</h2></center>

<blockquote>
The KOMP target list, as of December 2006, consisted of 4,442 genes. It is
expected that these will all have entered the targeting pipeline by September
2009. During this time, community and NIH Institutes and Centers input will
be used to identify high priority genes that should be targeted first, as
well as additional targets that should be added to the list.  The purpose
of this prioritization process is to provide targets of immediate interest
to the research community. It is expected that the turn around from
prioritization to ES cell will be 8-10 months, depending on demand.
<p>
Thus, KOMP target genes will be prioritized based on the number of nominations
received.  One may vote for as many genes as desired, but may not vote for the
same gene more than once.  All votes will be tabulated and weighted equally,
with priority score being determined by the number of multiple, independent
votes for a target.  Nominations will be tabulated and reviewed on a monthly
basis and the priority list for the KOMP centers will be adjusted accordingly.
A new nomination may move ahead of older nominations if it has a higher
priority score, unless the lower priority gene has already entered the
production pipeline.
<p>
An additional written justification may improve the prioritization but is not
required.  For example, justification for a disease related gene, pathway or
gene family would be highly useful.
<p>
It is expected that the target list will be expanded as annotation of the
mouse genome proceeds. In the near term, non-KOMP target genes may be added
to the list. Non-KOMP target genes will be evaluated based on the amount of
information and annotation available about that gene, and scientific review
of the written proposal, which, for non-KOMP target genes is required. The
proposals will be evaluated on a rolling schedule by members of the KOMP Panel
of Scientific Consultants/Advisors and NIH program officers.  Upon approval,
genes not previously on the KOMP gene list will be added to the list and
prioritized.
<p>
The nomination form allows one to indicate a preferred targeting strategy.
The final decision on type of knock-out to be made (deletion or targeted trap)
will depend on the scientific feasibility. In some instances, a specific
request may not be possible to accommodate.
